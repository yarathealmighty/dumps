Cicero, Phil. 2.16: Quod autem idem maestitiam meam   reprehendit, idem iocum, magno argumento est me in utroque fuisse moderatum. Cicero, ND 1.1 (LCL 268): De qua tam variae sunt doctissimorum hominum tamque discrepantes sententiae, ut magno argumento esse debeat causam et principium philosophiae esse inscientiam, prudenterque Academicos a rebus incertis adsensionem cohibuisse. In these two passages from Cicero, the clausal kernel is [x] magno argumento est [infinitive clause]. In the passage from Philippics, a quod clause serves as the subject. In the passage from De Natura Deorum , there is no explicit subject, but I believe the previous statement is meant to be the implicit subject. I understand magno argumento as a dative of service argument, which is common with linking verbs. But both passages then include an infinitive clause. The clause seems to contain the proposition for which the subject constitutes an argument. My question is how to understand the syntax of this infinitive clause. Is it a substantive clause depending on argumento ? The presence of a dative argument makes me disinclined to identify it as a predicate of esse .\",\n          \"Peculiar use of 'neque' In Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata Pars I, cap. VI it says, Quam longa est via Flaminia? Neque ea tam longa est quam via Appia. I am unsure as to how to translate 'neque' here or rather why it is used here. Intuitively, I would translate the response as, 'It is not as long as the Via Appia.' But then why does it say 'neque' instead of 'non'?\",\n          \"Is there a Latin version of \\\"Quick brown fox...\\\"? \\\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\\" is an English pangram, i.e. a phrase or sentence that contains all the letters of the alphabet (Wiki). Pangrams are often used in font typography to show off all the letters used in that font, with the purpose of trying to fit as many letters in together naturally in the shortest meaningful phrase or sentence. While there are shorter now, for English \\\"quick brown fox...\\\" accomplishes that nicely. My question is simple. Has someone already done this for Latin? As you can imagine, Googling would be a nightmare, since Latin refers to both the alphabet and the language, and even where people refer to the language, they often just discuss translating the English phrase above, which doesn't really do any good in getting to a nice, Latin pangram. Bonus points if it's pure Classical Latin.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5884,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Roby (1892: A Grammar of the Latin Language from Plautus to Suetonius , Part II, Book IV; pref. p. 30) put forward a nice parallelism between the two examples below (like yours both are from Cicero), which can be taken as evidence for the predicative nature of both argumentum and argumento (NB: due to this kind of parallellism the latter is often called a \\\"predicative dative\\\": e.g. see this video ). Both examples also contain (i) an infinitival clause, which, as you point out, can be said to be an argument of the predicative noun, and (ii) a substantive clause introduced by the conj. quod , which is the subject. Like Cerberus I give a positive answer to the question in the title but I would like to stress that the same answer holds for argumentum below, which can also be said to take an explanatory infinitive. Your question is then independent from the fact that the predicate is a dative ( argumento ) since one could raise the very same question for nom. argumentum in the first example below. I'm also saying this because of your last comment in your post above (\\\"The presence of a dative argument makes me disinclined to identify it as a predicate of esse \\\"). By the way, why do you call the dative an \\\"argument\\\" here? As noted, it's a predicate. Maxumum vero argumentum est naturam ipsam de inmortalitate animorum tacitam iudicare , quod omnibus curae sunt, et maxumae quidem, quae post mortem futura sint. (Cic. Tusc. 1. 31). 'But the strongest proof that nature itself tacitly pronounces in favor of the immortality of the souls is that everyone feels the concern, and even the greatest concern, of what must happen after death.' magno que esse argumento homines scire pleraque ante quam nati sint , quod iam pueri, cum artis difficilis discant, ita celeriter res innumerabilis arripiant, ut eas non tum primum accipere videantur, sed reminisci et recordari. haec Platonis fere. (Cic. Sen. 78) 'And a strong argument that men's knowledge of numerous things antedates their birth is the fact that mere children, in studying difficult subjects, so quickly lay hold upon innumerable things that they seem not to be then learning them for the first time, but to be recalling and remembering them. This, in substance, is Plato's teaching'.

Via Latina non tam longa est quam via Appia. Quam longa est via Flaminia? Neque ea tam longa est quam via Appia. Before we look this up, let's remember that LLPSI is supposed to teach us Latin. What can this sentence possibly mean? We just met the Via Latina, which was not as long as the super-long Via Appia. Now comes the Via Flaminia, and \\u2026 it is also not as long it is not as long either it too is not as long Get it?

My guess is that there might have been an error in the manuscript, but I can't think of what it would be changed to, not yet. Looking around led me to a few more here and one from here , but they're dubious. The first one I mentioned apparently has already been offered as a Latin version of \\\"Quick brown fox...\\\", too.

Cicero, ND 1.1 (LCL 268): De qua tam variae sunt doctissimorum hominum tamque discrepantes sententiae, ut magno argumento esse debeat causam et principium philosophiae esse inscientiam, prudenterque Academicos a rebus incertis adsensionem cohibuisse. In these two passages from Cicero, the clausal kernel is [x] magno argumento est [infinitive clause]. In the passage from Philippics, a quod clause serves as the subject. In the passage from De Natura Deorum , there is no explicit subject, but I believe the previous statement is meant to be the implicit subject. I understand magno argumento as a dative of service argument, which is common with linking verbs. But both passages then include an infinitive clause. The clause seems to contain the proposition for which the subject constitutes an argument. My question is how to understand the syntax of this infinitive clause. Is it a substantive clause depending on argumento ? The presence of a dative argument makes me disinclined to identify it as a predicate of esse .\",\n          \"Peculiar use of 'neque' In Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata Pars I, cap. VI it says, Quam longa est via Flaminia? Neque ea tam longa est quam via Appia. I am unsure as to how to translate 'neque' here or rather why it is used here. Intuitively, I would translate the response as, 'It is not as long as the Via Appia.' But then why does it say 'neque' instead of 'non'?\",\n          \"Is there a Latin version of \\\"Quick brown fox...\\\"? \\\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\\" is an English pangram, i.e. a phrase or sentence that contains all the letters of the alphabet (Wiki). Pangrams are often used in font typography to show off all the letters used in that font, with the purpose of trying to fit as many letters in together naturally in the shortest meaningful phrase or sentence. While there are shorter now, for English \\\"quick brown fox...\\\" accomplishes that nicely. My question is simple. Has someone already done this for Latin? As you can imagine, Googling would be a nightmare, since Latin refers to both the alphabet and the language, and even where people refer to the language, they often just discuss translating the English phrase above, which doesn't really do any good in getting to a nice, Latin pangram.

Both examples also contain (i) an infinitival clause, which, as you point out, can be said to be an argument of the predicative noun, and (ii) a substantive clause introduced by the conj. quod , which is the subject. Like Cerberus I give a positive answer to the question in the title but I would like to stress that the same answer holds for argumentum below, which can also be said to take an explanatory infinitive. Your question is then independent from the fact that the predicate is a dative ( argumento ) since one could raise the very same question for nom. argumentum in the first example below. I'm also saying this because of your last comment in your post above (\\\"The presence of a dative argument makes me disinclined to identify it as a predicate of esse \\\"). By the way, why do you call the dative an \\\"argument\\\" here? As noted, it's a predicate. Maxumum vero argumentum est naturam ipsam de inmortalitate animorum tacitam iudicare , quod omnibus curae sunt, et maxumae quidem, quae post mortem futura sint. (Cic. Tusc. 1. 31). 'But the strongest proof that nature itself tacitly pronounces in favor of the immortality of the souls is that everyone feels the concern, and even the greatest concern, of what must happen after death.' magno que esse argumento homines scire pleraque ante quam nati sint , quod iam pueri, cum artis difficilis discant, ita celeriter res innumerabilis arripiant, ut eas non tum primum accipere videantur, sed reminisci et recordari. haec Platonis fere. (Cic. Sen. 78) 'And a strong argument that men's knowledge of numerous things antedates their birth is the fact that mere children, in studying difficult subjects, so quickly lay hold upon innumerable things that they seem not to be then learning them for the first time, but to be recalling and remembering them. This, in substance, is Plato's teaching'. (Transl. by William Armistead Falconer, 1923, Perseus site)\",\n          \" The text goes as follows: Brundisium non est prope Romam, sed procul ab Roma: via Appia longa est. Via Latina non tam longa est quam via Appia. Quam longa est via Flaminia? Neque ea tam longa est quam via Appia. Before we look this up, let's remember that LLPSI is supposed to teach us Latin. What can this sentence possibly mean? We just met the Via Latina, which was not as long as the super-long Via Appia. Now comes the Via Flaminia, and \\u2026 it is also not as long it is not as long either it too is not as long Get it?

The translation I see floating around the internet is odd, though: Thus fleeing, O leader, you are regarded with jealousy like Karus. Making that work would take some loosening of the grammar. My guess is that there might have been an error in the manuscript, but I can't think of what it would be changed to, not yet. Looking around led me to a few more here and one from here , but they're dubious. The first one I mentioned apparently has already been offered as a Latin version of \\\"Quick brown fox...\\\", too.

So I see \"vel\", \"aut\", and \"-ve\" being used (mostly) interchangeably in the Latin I read. Is there any idiomatic difference, or can they be used interchangeably?

From Wikipedia , I see the meaning is \"you must die\" but that makes it sound like a threat. Legend said that one of the war prisoner use the word for mocking the Caesar. Is there any better translation or meaning for it? Many Christian priests use it for Sunday service speech opening, to remind us that we\\'re only mortals. So in my comprehension it means [remember that] \"you/everyone will die someday\". Is that correct?', 'Why does \"ut\" mean such different things when it has a subjunctive verb vs. an indicative one? We all know that ut , when paired with a subjunctive, is translated as \"in order to\" (purpose), \"to\" (indirect command), and, with some words, \"that\" (result/fear). However, ut with an indicative means \"(just) as\". I can\\'t figure out how subjunctive/indicative makes that transformation. After all, subjunctive just adds a sense of \"maybe\", right? How does that change \"just as\" into three other apparently different things? What underlying concept ties them all together? In short, why does ut mean such different things when all that changes is the mood of the verb? NB: I can understand why adding some words changes the meaning. I\\'m confused about why the mood has such a drastic effect.', 'Is \"ergo\" an appropriate word for this context?

I came across the term mendicus in a 16th century English parish register. According to Lewis & Short it means: \"beggarly, needy, in want, indigent\". I understand the word derives from menda meaning fault, blemish, or physical defect. Under the Poor Law system there came to be various classifications of poor : the impotent poor (physically unable), able-bodied poor (unable to find work), idle poor (unwilling to work), and vagrants or beggars (potentially criminal). Does the use of the word mendicus imply any one of these types of poverty? From the derivation it appears its meaning is most consistent with impotent poor (i.e. someone unable to work rather than unwilling). However I am unsure if this subtlety of meaning would have persisted through to the modern era.', 'Quid a \"hic\", \"munere\" significat Linnæus? These words are inscribed over the entrance to the University of Pavia: Quid hic ? Intueri naturam. Quo munere ? Curiosum esse. They\\'re translated here into Italian, which I\\'ll translate into English as: What do you do here? Study nature. What for? Pure curiosity. The Latin was written by Linnaeus in the introduction to the Systema Naturæ . While struggling to read the whole introduction, I\\'ve come to wonder if the Italian translation has it wrong. At my elementary level of Latin, the question seems to turn largely on whether the vowel in hic is long or short. Here\\'s Linnaeus\\'s original opening: Homo mundi intraturus theatrum quæritur Quis fit: Unde ortus? e stemmate Creationis; Quo tendat? ad vitam beatam; Quid hic ? intueri naturam; Quo munere ? Curiosum esse similemque quidem reliquis animantibus (quæ vorant, ludunt, pruriunt, generant, multiplicantur, dormiunt, commoda stabula quærunt, proximis sui generis inserviunt, vitam tuentur, sentiunt, percipiunt) sed nobiliorem, utpote qui curiosius observat quæ sensibus patent, indeque sapientibus ratiocinando rite concludit, adeoque miratur pulchrum sapientis opus Artificis. O quam contemta res est Homo, nisi supra humana se erexerit! Quid enim erat cur in numero viventium se positum gauderet? an ut Cibos & Potiones percolaret? ut hoc corpus casurum periturumque farciret? quae tanta necessitas in fundum telluris intimæ hominem mersit, ut oblitus dierum, oblitus fortunæ melioris, ab hoc se averteret? puto certe multos ad sapientiam perventuros, nisi superbia magnæ fortunæ inflati, putassent se pervenisse. Sapiens utique est, qui fines respicit. Finis Creationis Telluris est gloria DEI, ex opere Naturæ, per Hominem solum. Here\\'s my very uncertain translation. Unlike with the Italian, I had to go to the dictionary many times, which is a sure sign that I\\'m misunderstanding something important. In particular, I was stumped by the various definitions of munus . For Man, about to enter into the theater of the world, the question arises, Who is being made: Whence did I arise? out of the crown of Creation; What should I strive for? the happy, blessed life; What\\'s that ? contemplating nature; By what duty/power? the duty/power of diligent inquiry—which is like the powers of the other living things (who eat, play, itch, reproduce, are multiplied, sleep, seek comfortable places to rest, attend to others of their kind nearby, maintain their life, feel, perceive) but nobler, since one who observes more diligently what is open to the senses, and from there proceeds by wise deduction, solemnly discovers how truly marvelous is nature—the beautiful work of the wise Maker. O what a despicable thing is Man, unless he raises himself above the human! For why should he rejoice to count himself among the living? to filter food and drink through himself? to stuff this body, soon to fall and perish? what necessity is so great as to immerse a man in the most profound depths of the Earth—to forget days, forget greater prosperity, turn himself away from it? Surely, I reckon, many about to attain wisdom, if not puffed up by the pride of great fortune, had supposed themselves to have already attained it. Undoubtedly, wise is one who considers the ends of things. The end of the Earth\\'s Creation is the glory of GOD, out of the work of Nature, through Man alone. I\\'m uncertain of much of this translation, but hĭc vs. hīc and the appropriate sense of munus are my biggest sources of confusion. If it\\'s actually hĭc , then the passage is not about what happens \"here\", but a sermon about man\\'s place in the universe. Lacking a macron, I\\'m inferring the vowel quantity from the rest of the paragraph! Of course, if you\\'d like to correct any of my other errors, I\\'d be grateful. I must be wrong about what inflati modifies: my interpretation would make it inflatos; and my reading of putassent mixes the subjunctive with the accusative-and-infinitive. I\\'ve looked into other English translations of the introduction, and they\\'ve been abbreviated and/or lacked the poetry and passion of Linnaeus\\'s writing—or at least, from what I\\'ve been able to discern so far, it sure appears that Linnaeus intended no dry summary, but to stir the soul with the spirit of science.', 'Does “comperendinare” really mean “to adjourn for three days” (or similar) and if yes, how do we know this? According to my (German) Latin dictionary ( Stowasser ), comperendinō means to summon for the third-next day of court (für den drittnächsten Gerichtstag vorladen). It always struck me as bizarre that a word should have such a specific meaning. Other sources I can find online offer the same or similar meanings involving three or more days of adjournment or similar. I am curious about the following: Is that actually correct? If yes, how do we know this? If yes, do we have any idea why Latin developed a word for such a specific meaning?', 'Vivitne metaphora \"de\" in \"demonstro\"? I found the following inscription above a sundial outside the York Minster: LVCEM DEMONSTRAT VMBRA This seems extraordinarily poetic to me, for many reasons. One reason is the reversal of prosaic word order, aligning with the reversal of light\\'s ordinary role from what shows us things to the thing being shown. Another reason is more of a guess on my part: does de- suggest a perspective of looking downward upon something—even in the word demonstro ? If so, then the sentence reverses light in another way, since normally sunlight is above and shadow is below. I\\'ve been thinking that the primary sense of de is a perspective of \"from higher to lower\", as in de\\xa0cælo demissus , descendo , etc., and the other senses, such as \"about\", \"all the way\", and \"to destruction\", are extensions of the primary sense—and as often happens, the primary sense tends to linger on in the secondary senses. \"About\", as in the topic of a book, fits the perspective of looking down from above, where you can \"see\" the whole of the topic. Destruere is to send what has been built back down to the ground; devolvere is to roll downhill or delegate authority \"downward\"; and countless more examples. Deesse is to be away from where you\\'re expected, suggesting that de takes a steady, upright perspective from which other things are perceived as falling down or straying. Even much later neologisms seem to retain this meaning, like \"decadent\", which seems to emphasize falling away from a higher state of culture. I\\'ve inferred this somewhat subconsciously from learning words and reading, not from any explicit description, though I just checked Forcellini and he seems to agree that the spatial sense is the primary one. If I\\'m wrong about this, please let me know. Assuming that the spatial sense is primary, then, is it a completely dead metaphor in demonstro or does that word still convey some sense of a perspective of looking down from a higher perspective, somehow \"coming down\"? Are there other pithy or poetic Latin sentences whose punch de rives from activating the downward spatial sense of \"de\" even in a word that seems to have forgotten it? Or to put this yet another way, what does demonstro have that monstro lacks?', 'Is \"victa serpente\" an ablative absolute? I\\'m reading Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses, and there\\'s this sentence: Delius hunc nuper, victa serpente superbus , viderat adducto flectentem cornua nervo “quid” que “tibi, lascive puer, cum fortibus armis?” dixerat: ... emphasis mine The phrase looks to me like an ablative absolute -- noun and participle, both in the ablative, set off from the rest of the sentence -- but the teacher translated it as \"arrogant thanks to the victory over the serpent\", which doesn\\'t sound like one. Is this just a colloquial translation, or is it not an ablative absolute?', \"Why does a future passive participle have a sense of necessity? Let me use an example to clarify: Puer librum legendum habet Very, very literally, this would be: The boy has a book going to be read This has the sense of happening in the future and passivity, and acts as a participle (as far as I can tell), but for some reason this isn't the translation. Instead, future passive participles carry a sense of necessity: The boy has a book having to be read Where did that come from?\", '\"Miserando atque eligendo\" There seem to be two schools of thought about the meaning of the motto on Pope Francis\\'s coat of arms: miserando atque eligendo These words are taken from the 21st homily of the Venerable Bede , describing Jesus\\'s first meeting with Matthew: Vidit ergo Jesus publicanum, et quia miserando atque eligendo vidit, ait illi, ‘Sequere me’. One school of thought, represented by Fr. Z , says that the phrase has two ablative gerunds and describes Jesus\\'s way of seeing: \"by showing compassion and by choosing.\" Fr. Z would translate the sentence \"Jesus, therefore, saw the publican, and because he saw by having mercy and by choosing, He said to him, ‘Follow me.\\'\" Ron Conte , representing the other school of thought, says that\\'s a literal, word-by-word translation that misses the meaning, as such an approach to translation often does. Conte would translate the motto \"pitiable yet chosen\", and the whole sentence\\n“Then Jesus saw the publican, and because he saw [him to be] pitiable and yet elect, he said to him: Follow me.” Most commonly, the motto is translated \"lowly but chosen.\" My problem with Fr. Z\\'s interpretation is that it doesn\\'t make sense. What does it mean to \"see by choosing\"? My problem with Ron Conte\\'s interpretation is that I don\\'t understand the grammar. Miserando and eligendo appear to be ablatives describing vidit . Or perhaps there are some elided words and the sentence should be understood like this: Vidit ergo Jesus publicanum, et quia [eum] miserando atque eligendo [esse] vidit, ait illi, ‘Sequere me’. But I still don\\'t understand that. What does it mean to use an ablative gerund as a predicate like that? Why not a gerundive, like eum miserandum atque eligendum esse vidit ? Does the fact that miseror can also be understood as a deponent verb play a role here? Might these actually be dative gerunds?', 'meaning of \"non omnínó\" Omnínó is defined in Lewis Elementary as altogether, wholly, entirely, utterly, at all [with numerals] in all, altogether, only, but, just by all means, indeed, doubtless, yes, certainly, to be sure in general, generally, universally But I\\'m unsure of how to translate/interpret it when it\\'s negative.

And whichever one it means, how would I say the other?', 'Can \"simultas\" simply mean \"task,\" or does it always connote hostility? In his tale of Æetes, Hyginus writes Itaque Æeta Jasoni hanc simultatem constituit: Si vellet pellem auratam auferre, tauros æripedes … jungeret … Lewis & Short gives this definition for simultas : A hostile encounter, dissension, enmity, rivalry, jealousy, grudge, hatred, animosity a strife, contest At first I tried to translate the Hyginus passage And so Ætes conceived this enmity for Jason: If he wanted, etc. But that doesn\\'t make any sense at all. In The Myths of Hyginus , Mary Grant translates this passage And so Aeetes appointed this task for Jason: If he wished, etc. Is \"task\" a recognized meaning of simultas that Lewis & Short just leave out? And, if so, does it have a connotation of hostility, as the other definitions might suggest?', \"What is the meaning and use of the word 'Duco'? I want to confirm my understanding of the word duco .

I left him behind, since of course he couldn\\'t enter Tartarus. Mansi, quippe qui eum in Tartarum comitari non possem. I stayed, since of course I couldn\\'t accompany him into Tartarus.

Having finally gotten a basic handle on the sorts of things rés can mean, I find myself stymied by ratió . I\\'ve understood it as meaning essentially \"process of (logical) thinking,\" and that tends to work, though what it means more specifically in any given circumstance still evades me far more often than I\\'d like. But then I see Cicero\\'s In Catilinam II.V.9, which begins Atque, ut ejus díversa studia in dissimilí ratióne perspicere possitis. . . . which I would translate, if I were sacrificing style to exactitude of meaning, But, that you might be able to see clearly his various enthusiasms by a different thought process. . . . Cicero then goes on to offer two metaphors: that of a gladiator inclined to crime and that of a worthless, good-for-nothing actor. My inclination here would be to think that ratio referred to the method Cicero was using to describe Catiline\\'s associates—a Latin version of \"let me say it in another way.\" The translations that I\\'ve seen, however, seem to take a different approach. Michael Grant\\'s (which to be sure often goes for elegance and style over meaning) is And note well the diversity of his interests, the wide range of his activities. Gould and Whiteley, in their student commentary, offer for dissimilí ratióne in a very different sphere. Yonge translates the clause And, that you may understand the diversity of his pursuits and the variety of his designs. . . . In all of these, the translators seem to be taking ratió as referring to Catiline\\'s actions or habits. And I\\'m having a lot of trouble understanding ratió as \"activities,\" \"sphere,\" or even \"designs.\" This last comes closest to my understanding of ratió , but it\\'s still pretty far from it. Can somebody help me out? What am I missing?', 'Flavor/meaning/nuance of \"aliquando\" in \"tandem aliquando\"? The first sentence of Cicero\\'s second Catilinarian reads in part Tandem aliquando, Quirites, L. Catilinam . . . ex urbe . . . ejecimus. (I realize I\\'m leaving out all the fun parts; forgive me.) You can\\'t say \"Finally at some point, Romans,\" etc. in English, so I\\'m trying to figure out what flavor aliquando adds to tandem . Yonge translates the part I\\'ve quoted as At length, O Romans, we have dismissed from the city . . . Lucius Catiline. and Grant gives At long last, citizens, Lucius Catilina . . . has been expelled from Rome. \"At length\" seems like a straight translation of tandem . I imagine that \"at long last\" could add to \"at last\" a flavor of having waited for something a very long time, but I could also just be making that up. A search of the corpus for tandem aliquando shows several occurrences (many in the Catilinarians), but I can\\'t figure out from any of the rest of them what \"aliquando\" is doing. What\\'s the difference between tandem and tandem aliquando ?', 'What\\'s the difference between \"media\" and \"medio\" in \"virtus in medio stat\"? In Wikipedia\\'s list of Latin phrases , the expression virtus in medio stat is included, with the explanation: Idiomatically: Good practice lies in the middle path. There is disagreement as to whether \"medi a \" or \"medi o \" is correct. If my deductive reasoning skills have not failed me, the word in question here is medius .  In Lewis & Short\\'s definition , I see examples of both in media and in medio , so I\\'m assuming that Wikipedia\\'s \"correct\" refers not to rules of grammar but to some \"official\" origin of the phrase. Even if that\\'s the case, however, it\\'s not clear to me if there is an actual difference in meaning between the two.  So, are both versions grammatically acceptable?  If so, are their meanings different, or is it simply a variation in syntax?', 'Can Latin \"inde\" introduce a temporal clause? Lines one and two of book 2 of Vergil\\'s Aeneid sparked this question: Conticuere omnes intentique ora tenebant inde toro pater Aeneas sic orsus ab alto: I had two interpretations. My first interpretation is that the -que in intentique links the verbs conticuere (perfect active indicative) and tenebant . However, that makes it unclear as to how the second line connects grammatically to the first unless inde can somehow be used as an introduction to a temporal clause, but I was under the impression (perhaps too narrow) that only dum, cum, donec, postquam, ubi , and ut could introduce temporal clauses. My other interpretation was that -que links the two clauses with the first line just having a missing conjunction for poetic effect: \"All were silent [and] attentive were holding their mouths and from there ...\". However, this version feels weird considering the placement of -que . What would a contemporary Roman perceive the -que as connecting?', 'Is this translation of \"new mind/attitude\" correct?

L&S lists a number of other meanings, but in my knowledge these are two very frequent uses, that do not seem to have much in common. I have always wondered whether there is any documented history to explain such different meanings. Was it just the fruit of convergent evolution, a complex process of meaning change from a common original meaning, or something different? I find it even funny that with time in Ecclesiastical Latin both meanings came to be close to opposite: the World as the realm of sin and death , and cleanliness as the absense of evil. My research so far: There is a Proto-IE root related to mundus meaning to adorn, which would explain most of the clean meaning, but I have not found anything for the world part. Latin also has the words Terra and Universum . Terra means Earth (as a part of the whole world, as I understand from the first quote to Cicero in L&S, which makes sense to me). It also has a close PIE root with the same meaning. That seems to suggest terra predates mundus . About universum I do not have so many clues, except that it seems to be a composite of uni+versus, the later having some ancient semantic field related to turning .\", 'What does Bede\\'s phrase, \"suae genti ducatum praebebat, obtinuit,\" mean?

This is about the core meaning of desinat in piscem as in: Humano capiti ceruicem pictor equinam iungere si uelit et uarias inducere plumas undique collatis membris, ut turpiter atrum desinat in piscem mulier formosa superne, spectatum admissi, risum teneatis, amici? [ Quintus Horatius Flaccus (Horace), The Art of Poetry: an Epistle\\n  to the Pisos ] Of course I understand desino/ere is a transitive verb meaning to end (in) and there\\'s the preposition in and the accusative piscem , literally (I\\'m guessing) end in fish . 1 I would describe the image the author crafts as an example of a type mismatch of sorts but this is not the point. The Gaffiot Dictionary also refers to Virg. En 10, 211; Sen. Ep. 92, 10; 66, 43 for the expression. As far as fish are concerned, they don\\'t necessarily strike as beautiful-looking creatures (but then again it\\'s all a matter of perspective). There\\'s also morphology, which might vary depending on where one lives, and often the fish is wider in the middle and ends with a smaller section before the tail, so there\\'s a contrasting element. Otherwise I\\'m not clear on the eating habits of the classical authors (and it\\'s off topic) but more importantly I\\'m not clear on the references they might have about fish and how this translates into Latin, into this desinat in piscem . In Horace\\'s, Seneca\\'s, and Virgil\\'s Latin, does desinat in piscem refer to the end/tail/shape of the fish, or rather its looks ? Is\\nthat some figurative use for some bad omen or a non sequitur , or\\njust plain bad taste or what exactly? How and why are they using this?

Is such non-biological use, if it exists, restricted to adoptive sons?\\nFor example, can a teacher refer to his student as a filius if there is no family relation between them whatsoever?\\nI am only interested in a filius of a person, not expressions like fortunae filius . Lewis & Short seems to say that a person's filius is a biological descendant, most typically a son.\\nHowever, the inscription was certainly not from classical antiquity, so the definition of L&S might not have been valid when it was inscribed.\", 'What was a draco? The Latin dictionaries I checked suggest that the word draco is attested in classical literature and it is often translated as \"dragon\".\\nHowever, it is my impression — which may well be wrong! — that the current dragon imagery in popular culture comes mainly from China or that region of Asia more broadly.\\nTherefore I suspect that my intuitive image of a dragon might be far from what the Romans meant by a draco . So, what was a draco ?\\nCould it be just any snake or serpent, or did it refer to something more specific?\\nHave we identified a species that the Romans would call draco ?\\nWas it a real thing or something more mystical?\\nAre there illustrations of what a draco is?', 'What is the meaning of \"Ex Lux\", the name of Lucifer Morningstar\\'s new bar? I\\'ve been a fan of Mike Carey\\'s Lucifer comic series, for its believable portrait of a fallen angel. The series spun off from Neil Gaiman\\'s The Sandman , which established this incarnation of Lucifer Morningstar. In short, Lucifer gets tired of the role given to him by God, so he abandons Hell and opens a piano bar on Earth called \"Lux\" (best in LA!). I know \"lux\" means \"light\", so this one is ok. Now there\\'s a new Lucifer series , set right after the previous run. In it, Lucifer returns to Earth and opens a bar called \"Ex Lux\" : I\\'d have missed him, had I not read the original series right before reading this one :D What does \"ex lux\" mean? This website says \"lightbringer\", and I\\'d be inclined to believe it (because Lightbringer is Lucifer official title), had it not listed \"machine translation\" as its source. I could try to scrape the barrel of my Latin knowledge, and suggest that it means \"from light\" - using \"deus ex machina\" as a reference point - but I don\\'t dare. Instead, I\\'m asking here: what does \"ex lux\" mean?', 'What\\'s the best translation of \"vindice\" in Met. 1.89? I was translating this verse, and although I came up with several candidates for translating vindice , I am still not sure about the intended meaning. Aurea prima sata est aetas, quae vindice nullo, sponte sua, sine lege fidem rectumque colebat. (Met. 1.89–90) First was sown the golden age, which, with no protector, of its own will fostered faith and virtue without law. Is the intended meaning of this word \"protector\"? Or is it more specific, e.g. \"government\"? How would you translate vindice ?', \"When should the perfect tenses be used? No matter the language, it seems as if the perfect tenses (except for the future perfect) can be replaced with the imperfect. In translation, why do these sets of tenses have different meaning? I don't understand their difference other than the way they're worded. Sometimes, I see example sentences on dictionary sites with translations aside them. They'll have an English imperfect rendered by a Latin perfect/pluperfect. Are there situations in which a phrase should be translated in a different tense than its equivalent in another language?\", '\"Ad populum\" idiom Is \"ad populum\" ever seen as an idiom for \"popular\", or can it only mean \"to the people\"?

Calvin's commentary on Romans 1:18 ( Latin , English translation by MacKenzie): Ira, ἀνθρωποπαθῶς, more Scripturae pro ultione Dei: quia Deus puniens, prae se fert (nostra opinione) irascentis faciem. The word wrath , referring to God in human terms as is usual in Scripture, means the vengeance of God, for when God punishes, He has, according to our way of thinking, the appearance of anger. Nullum ergo motum in Deo significat: sed tantum ad sensum peccatoris, qui plectitur, relationem habet. The word, therefore, implies no emotion in God, but has reference only to the feelings of the sinner who is punished. How accurate is this translation? In particular, I am wondering whether this use of motum 'movement' is nothing more than a typical assertion of divine impassibility , or whether it is stronger, not denying merely that he has no passions (involuntary/passive responses) but also that he has no true active and transcendent anger. Does anyone know how the Reformation era use of the concept of movement, signified by moveo/motum , maps onto our contemporary concepts? ( Oxford Dictionaries say that the current sense of emotion dates only from the 19th century.)\", \"A semantic question about αὐτόματος Here is a question related to the one I asked about an hour ago: As an adjective, the main meaning of αὐτόματος is self-willed , but as a noun, it primarily means accident or chance , according to this Wikipedia page .

If so, is this word similar to φάρμακον , which means both a healing drug and poison, a gathering of contraries?\", 'Has the meaning of any Latin adjectives narrowed in a way similar to English \"gay\" transitioning from a meaning of \"happy\" to \"homosexual\"? The English words \" gay \" and \" queer \" are originally adjectives with a broad range of possible use contexts, but currently they are used almost exclusively in reference to certain minorities.\\nIt has become difficult to use these words in their original meaning and tone; trying to use \"gay\" as a synonym of \"happy\" without any homosexual connotations seems almost impossible to me.\\nMoreover, some people learning English today are unaware of these other (older?) meanings altogether. Are there words like \"gay\" and \"queer\" in Latin?\\nThat is, are there any similar cases in Latin, where an originally broader adjective has come to refer to something very specific, possibly a group of people? Which Latin adjectives are closest to the phenomenon seen in the two English examples? Is there, by any chance, a (substantivized?)

BACKGROUND I understand that neither τύραννος , δεσπότης , nor dictātor implies, at least in its primary sense, that the one so named ruled badly.  For example, Oedipus was τύραννος without being tyrannical in our sense.

Apuleius, Metamorphoses VI.24.3: scaena sibi sic concinnata ut Musae quidem chorum canerent, tibias inflaret Saturus, et Paniscus ad fistulam diceret . This is from the Loeb edition , which translates it as follows: \"She had arranged the stage so that the Muses were singing in chorus, a Satyr blew the flute, and a Paniscus played on the reed-pipes .\" Now, I have never seen dicere used to mean \"play [an instrument]\". Is this common? Or just extremely rare? Or an error by the Loeb edition? Here is the Cambridge edition : scaena sibi sic concinnata ut Musae quidem chorum canerent aut tibias inflaret, Saturus et Paniscus ad fistulam dicere n t. It translates the text as follows: \"...while a Satyr and a little Pan sang to the shepherd\\'s pipe.\" I must say this translation is much closer to what I would expect; at least Lewis & Short have dicere \"to sing\": To describe, relate, sing, celebrate in writing (mostly poet.): \"tibi dicere laudes\", Tib. 1, 3, 31; so, \"laudes Phoebi et Dianae\", Hor. C. S. 76: \"Dianam, Cynthium, Latonam\", id. C. 1, 21, 1: \"Alciden puerosque Ledae\", id. ib. 1, 12, 25: \"caelestes, pugilemve equumve\", id. ib. 4, 2, 19: \"Pelidae stomachum\", id. ib. 1, 6, 5: \"bella\", id.

H. 1, 1: \"vir neque silendus neque dicendus sine cura\", Vell. 2, 13.— And the Cambridge has a different Latin text, which I cannot judge, but which allows this translation, contrary to the Loeb\\'s Latin. At any rate, even the \"sing\" from the Cambridge seems different from the usage in L&S to me. For each of those quotations has a theme, i.e. a complement with an \\'object-like\\' meaning, such as a direct object or an noun that agrees with the gerundive of dicere . So I read the L&S definition as \"to sing [something] in writing\", which I would understand as \"to write about something in verse\". That hardly fits the Cambridge translation \"[they] sang to the shepherd\\'s pipe\", which strongly suggests oral singing, and without a theme. How would you feel about a translation \"they recited to the shephard\\'s pipe\"? Or is that too literal and simple-minded of me? I can imagine the Ancients\\' reciting to a musical instrument, although I\\'m not entirely sure whether I remember correctly that they did this (think of recitals like those in the Matthäus-Passion).', 'What does \"tellus\" mean?

On Wiktionary I have found meaning of only first parts of the word.', 'What\\'s the logic of sub- in words like suppleo and sufficio? The words suppleo and sufficio both derive from the prefix sub- (\"under\"), in which the \\'b\\' of sub- is assimilated into the following consonant. Both these words carry the connotation of \"being enough\", or \"meeting the needs of something or someone\". This connotation is absent without the prefix, i.e. facio and pleo do not have the same connotation, or at least, not to the same degree. This leads me to wonder how the prefix sub- could possibly weigh toward this meaning of \"being enough\", when paradoxically it means \"under\". To further complicate things, the opposite is achieved in the English word \"suboptimal\", which has the implication of something not being enough, contrary to words like \"supply\" and \"suffice\". How does sub- contribute to this connotation of \"being enough\", or \"meeting the needs of something/someone\", in Latin words like suppleo and sufficio ?', 'Is my interpretation of \"Ad Astra per Aspera\" correct? I came across the phrase ad astra per aspera — \"to the stars through difficulties.\" I think I know what it means, but my interpretation appears to be at odds with others.

Kansas earned the\\n  nickname \"Bloody Kansas\" because of the war regarding slavery, much of\\n  which was fought on Kansas\\' soil.\" Sure, I would agree with this meaning, but this is the context I would like to use it in: First, it\\'s an aspirational statement about achieving great things. However, it\\'s just as equally a moral claim that if greatness is acquired without suffering, hardship, or toil, then something is lost. Yet it also appears to be a claim that it is from these very hardships that one acquires this greatness. Am I reading into this a little too much?', 'What does \"ratio doloris\" mean?

BACKGROUND I am assuming that the phrase is intended to accomplish (b).  To express that in English, one might have to say: only by means of faith But \"sōlā fidē\" on the surface looks like: by means of faith whose number is one Which would not exclude any other means. Just for clarity, let me offer this analogy: (a) The screw can be tightened with a screw driver, of which there is but one instance (but there may be any number of other means to tighten a screw). (b) The screw can be tightened only with a screw driver (but there may be any number of screw drivers). The answer I expect might look like one of these. \"Sōlus\" generally qualifies the noun and sets its number at one, and \"sōlā fidē\" is no exception.  That is, the only thing \"sōlā\" does in it is to set the number of faith at one, i.e. (a) above.  If some Christians use it to exclude other means, i.e. (b), that is done through something other than strict meaning.  For example, \"sōlā fidē\" has become a slogan. \"Sōlus\" generally qualifies the noun and sets its number at one, but in some rare cases the word (as it were) comes out of the ablative context and qualifies the whole phrase to achieve the exclusion of other means. \"Sōlus\" generally has two functions, setting the number of the qualified noun at one or (as it were from outside the ablative context) exclude the availability of other means. ADDENDUM Or maybe I am totally wrong to be fixated on the number of anything?  Perhaps \"sōlus\" here just means \"unaccompanied\" and the whole phrase: by means of faith that is unaccompanied by anything else If so the phrase in and of itself would allow there being any number of faiths and any number of means of salvation, but simply assert that faith unaccompanied by anything is a means. On this view, \"sōlī Deō glōria\" too would just mean: glory to god as unaccompanied. That is to say, you can separately give glory to to your own nose.  Just don\\'t give it to god and your nose together. In sum, \"sōlus\" seems to be doing a job that it cannot do if it is confined to qualifying the noun either as to its number or state of being accompanied or not.', 'Please help translate this short Latin phrase left behind by a deceased man I worked an estate sale a few years ago and the experience has never left me.

I'm under the impression from a Latin dictionary that ossibus refers strictly to bones. So why are there variant translations of this seemingly simple word? I guess there are two sub-questions, any of which could answer the main question: Did the meaning of ossibus change over time? If so, what was the meaning of the word at the time of Virgil's writing. Is 'ashes' used only in translations where they want the two syllables for poetic meter or something?\", 'How did the literal meaning of \"putare\" develop into \"to judge, to think, etc.\"? For the verb puto -are , Cassell\\'s and Lewis & Short give a primary meaning of \"to clean, cleanse\" and a literal meaning of \"to trim, prune or lop trees or vines\". I can easily imagine the path that led from that to the figurative sense of clearing up, setting in order, or arranging, settling and adjusting. But the image is not so clear when the usage becomes more generalised, when the verb starts being applied to a wide range of cognitive processes. The dictionary entries give not only specific processes like judging, esteeming, computing, accounting and suspecting as legitimate readings, but also broader processes like thinking, imagining, supposing and believing. To me, this relation between \"cleansing, pruning, trimming\" and \"judging, reckoning, thinking, etc.\" is not obvious. I assume it was obvious to the Romans, so I am sure my failure in making a connection is just due to a lapse of imagination (and a lack of reading) on my part. At any rate, how do we account for this development? Do the Romans themselves have any explanations to offer?', 'Which modern cities are urbes?

I read in the very beginning of Platon\\'s Laches ( perseus edition ): τεθέασθε μὲν τὸν ἄνδρα μαχόμενον ἐν ὅπλοις, ὦ Νικία τε καὶ Λάχης: οὗ δ᾽ ἕνεκα ὑμᾶς ἐκελεύσαμεν συνθεάσασθαι ἐγώ τε καὶ Μελησίας ὅδε, τότε μὲν οὐκ εἴπομεν, νῦν δ᾽ ἐροῦμεν. ἡγούμεθα γὰρ χρῆναι πρός γε ὑμᾶς παρρησιάζεσθαι.

Why we asked you to watch it with us, Melesias here and myself, we did not tell you before but now we will, and the reason we will is that we are sure it is right and good to speak openly to you, given who you are . Kenneth Quandt writes about \"πρός γε ὑμᾶς\" (note 4): πρός γε ὑμᾶς, γε causal. and translates: [good to speak openly to] you, given who you are The particle γε has many meanings and I thought to something simpler, maybe \"to speak openly, especially to you \"(emphasis) or \"to speak openly, at any rate to you \"(restriction). Anyway, I never heard of a \"γε causal\" and I don\\'t understand what it could be but Quandt\\'s translation makes sense and sounds interesting.

It\\'s supposed to be an expression of eternity, and it\\'s commonly translated in English as \"forever and ever\". In Spanish it is much more literal than in English: \"por los siglos de los siglos\". But neither the Spanish nor the literal translation of the Latin seem to me to explicitly convey the meaning of eternity. In a way, the expression itself doesn\\'t make sense. Why \"of ages\"? What is \"an age of an age\"? More clear is in aeternum , which is used at least 223 times in the Vulgata (including in the Old Testament).

In Spanish we have a word escala that means \"stopover\" as \"a break in a journey\", specially when travelling by sea. According to the dictionary by the Royal Spanish Academy, the word comes from Italian scala, and this one from Byzantine Greek σκάλα skála meaning \"harbour\" (or maybe \"port\" as \"city with a harbour\"). But in a question a user commented (link in Spanish) that the word actually meant \"berth\" or \"mooring\" (as \"the point where a ship moors in a harbour\"). So what did the word σκάλα exactly mean in Byzantine Greek?', 'Did \"benedicere\" ever mean \"to blaspheme\"? I was struck by some verses in Chapter 21 of 3 Regum , Vulgata. This tells the story of Naboth, an Israelite who owned a vineyard which was adjacent to the palace of the Israeli King, Achab. Naboth didn\\'t want to sell the land to Achab. In return, the wife of Achab wrote letters to the leaders of Israel, in order to conspire against Naboth. Thus, verses 9 and 10 say: Litterarum autem haec erat sententia : Praedicate jejunium, et sedere facite Naboth inter primos populi, et submittite duos viros filios Belial contra eum, et falsum testimonium dicant : Benedixit Deum et regem : et educite eum, et lapidate, sicque moriatur. And it happened as the letters suggested, as the leaders of Israel praedicaverunt jejunium, et sedere fecerunt Naboth inter primos populi.\\n  Et adductis duobus viris filiis diaboli, fecerunt eos sedere contra eum : at illi, scilicet ut viri diabolici, dixerunt contra eum testimonium coram multitudine : Benedixit Naboth Deum et regem : quam ob rem eduxerunt eum extra civitatem, et lapidibus interfecerunt. [verses 12 and 13] The English translation gives \"blasphemed\" for benedixit , as it is expected, given the context of the story. However, this is the first time I see such a counterintuitive meaning of benedicere . L&S does not attest such meaning. Did it ever had this meaning? Why would Jerome use such a word, which pretty much everywhere else (?) is used to mean \"to bless\"? Am I missing something here?', \"Exact meaning of aurora in canon law? Aurora means dawn, that's well known. But there is more than one type of dawn. The English Wikipedia knows three types: astronomical (18°), nautical (12°) and civil dawn (sun 6° below the horizon). Latin Wikipedia knows - in the stub article Aurora - only the definition 6° below the horizon. I am searching for an exakt definition (or a rule of thumb) for the time of aurora in canon law. As it is used here: c. 821 § 1 CIC/1917 : Missae celebrandae initium ne fiat citius quam una hora ante auroram vel serius quam una hora post meridiem. The beginning of the celebrated mass shall not be before one hour before aurora and later than one hour after midday. [my translation] So the priest has to know when aurora is. There could be an specific canon-law definition or just the normal, traditional latin/roman definition. So I am interested in every definition avaivible, best canonistic/ecclesiastical, but ancient or medieval is okay too. It could use brightness, degree below the horizon or some other criterion.

Nonetheless, some related word such as inmersión and inmerso come from a similar Latin verb: immergo (inm-) , si, sum, 3 ( I. perf. sync. immersti, Plaut. Bacch. 4, 4, 26; acc. to the second conj., inf. pres. pass. immergeri, Col. 5, 9, 3), v. a. in-mergo, to dip, plunge, sink , or stick into any thing, to immerse (mostly poet. and in post-Aug. prose). The definitions for both verbs are quite similar, but only the summergo verb reached the Spanish language as sumergir . There were attempts to stablish an inmergir verb but the Royal Spanish Academy stated that such verb was pointless in the Spanish language. So, we have sumergir but not inmergir and I\\'m trying to understand why. I see in the definition for immergo that that verb was mostly used in poetry. So was it a cultured word and hence less used?

The OP (What does OP stand for?) advised a Russian colleague, presumably the rest of us, to ask a new Q if we wished to pursue this. What was required, here, was a quote from the literature. Overwhelmed at the prospect of such a search, deployed initiative, a pithy aphorism: \"(id est) iustum\" giving \"well-grounded\"; \"well-deserved\". The OP was, quite naturally, disgruntled; but, failed to respond to the follow-up--how would a Roman have interpreted this; if the Latin is incorrect, why is it?', '\"ne paelici suspectaretur\" (Tacitus) Tacitus, Annales 4.3: pellit domo Seianus uxorem Apicatam, ex qua tres liberos genuerat, ne paelici suspectaretur . The translation on Perseus (Church and Brodribb) gives: Sejanus, to avert his mistress\\'s jealousy , divorced his wife Apicata, by whom he had had three children. How does ne paelici suspectaretur mean to avert his mistress\\'s jealousy ? Ne suspectaretur is easy: \"lest he should be suspected\". Paelici is a dative of paelex \"mistress\". But I\\'m not seeing what a dative could be doing in this clause. Apparently, too, there\\'s an alternate reading of this phrase: L&S under suspecto quote this as ne pellici suspectaretur , with a passive infinitive of pellicio \"allure, entice\". It would then mean \"lest he be suspected of being enticed\". This at least works grammatically, but I\\'m not sure what it\\'s supposed to mean. What\\'s going on with this phrase?', 'Meaning of \"individuandum\" What is the meaning and structure of individuandum ? I guess that it is an accusative gerund of unknown verb to me.

Both nasciturus and nascendus seem to exist.  Words ending in -turus are often described as future active participles, and words ending in -ndus as future passive participles (they are also called gerundives), but as nascor is always an intransitive verb, it doesn\\'t seem like it could have any truly passive forms. (I think this differentiates nascendus from examples like patiendus, discussed in brianpck\\'s answer here: How do I use gerundives of obligation for deponent verbs? ) I would guess that there is a difference in meaning something like \"about to be born\" vs. \"needing to be born\", but I don\\'t understand the Latin participle system well enough to be sure. Research I found a passage in Ars by (pseudo?) Palaemon that mentions the two forms, but my Latin is not strong enough to extract any information about potential differences in meaning or usage between the two forms: futuri temporis participia a passivis vel communibus semper in dus. nam deponens numquam habet duo futura: nec enim dicimus \\'luctandus est ille\\' aut nascendus,   sed habet unum, ut luctaturus nasciturus locuturus; licet apud veteres talia quoque communis generis reperiantur. (\"De Participio\", Ars [sp.], in Keilor 1868, 546.9-13, accessed via PHI Latin Texts) I also found an interesting but not very enlightening anecdote about a poor gentleman who shared my confusion and was excoriated by a bishop ( The Downside Review, p. 228 ). Basically, all this does is confirm my understanding that both nasciturus and nascendus are valid forms. The bishop brings up the “ad homines nascendos vim hujus numeri (septenarii) pertinere ait” quote that is also mentioned in the Lewis and Short entry for nascor; L&S say that it can be translated as \"to the formation of man in the womb\". Searching for the text of this passage also led me to a section of Roby (1875; A Grammar of the Latin Language from Plautus to Suetonius, Part II ) that discusses this use of the gerundive. This was more helpful. Roby says that there are \"very few\" exceptions to the rule that the gerundive is passive, and therefore not used for intransitive verbs; he lists some examples and says \"three of them are from Varro; they are all expressions of the same nature and all from verbs in -sc- \" ( p. lxx ). The examples seem to go against my guess that the gerundive would have a sense of obligation in this context; Roby translates them with phrases like \"of the X-ing of Y\". After reading Roby, I have the impression that even though nascendus isn\\'t \\'wrong\\' per se, there wouldn\\'t be very many situations where I should use it.

The wiktionary tells me for the individual elements that \"μή is the negative of thought or wish\" and that ει is a kind of relative conjunction. That is, it would be relative-pronoun-like in spirit of the etymology. This synthesyzing is probably my main problem, but I am also troubled because there are no direct cognates in Germanic, as far as I am aware. The naive dictionary translation \"if not\" matches the translation at hand, but I wonder how biased this is by attempts to fit non-Greek grammars. The element of \"thought or wish\" at least is missing completely. It doesn\\'t help that etymologies of particles are often so convoluted as it seems. BTW: ei me apo is then translated as except of (Ger \"von\"), but apo well corresponds to off (Ger ab often combined with von , think get off of that horse ).

Thus, \"santiguar\" is used only to refer to making the sing of the cross. My question is about how \"santiguar\" gained such meaning.

However, digging further I also found that \"lucis\" can also mean light and \"aeternus\" is basically the masculine version of \"aeterna\". (Need verification on this) Also, just out of curiosity, the modern Italian translation (again from google) reads \"la luce eterna mi guidi\", and I can\\'t help but to wonder how did this evolve from traditional Latin. It\\'s pretty interesting.', 'How do you say to “bear in mind” or to always “keep in mind” in Latin? Self explanatory question. \\nOkay so I know the word ‘remember’ in Latin is ‘memento.’ but I heard that there are different variations like meminero or something, but is there a way to say “to keep in mind” or “bear in mind” keep it in your head and remember or etc. I looked around the forums but all I got was ’meminisse’ but I don’t know if that’s correct. And would it be different if you added an ‘always?’ \\nLike ALWAYS keep in mind and etc. The translation that I got was “semper meminisse” is that correct?', 'Meaning of \"cum inter nonnullos\" I\\'m reading The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco, which has a lot of Latin phrases and expressions, since the story is set in the 14th century and the protagonist is a franciscan friar. The expression I\\'m having trouble with is \"cum inter nonnullos\". With a bit of searching, I found this is the name of a short bull( a papal decree) declaring that the doctrine of poverty was heretical. But what does it mean in Latin? I could only find that it translates to something like \"Among other things\". Is it supposed to mean it was a decree about miscellaneous subjects?', 'Can one translate ἀθάνατος as \\'living\\' rather than \\'immortal\\'? Context There is an old hymn, often referred to as the Trisagion or Thrice-Holy. It goes like this in Greek: Ἅγιος ὁ Θεός, Ἅγιος ἰσχυρός, Ἅγιος ἀθάνατος, ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς. (Transliterated, this reads, \"Hágios ho Theós, Hágios ischyrós, Hágios athánatos, eléēson hēmâs.\", see comment below, which is now obsolete after this edit.) In English, one sees various translations: Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy and Immortal, have mercy on us. My Question So, considering God is the Only Living God, and \\'thanatos\\' is \\'death\\', while the prefix \\'a-\\' means \\'without\\', what would be wrong with translating \\'athanatos\\' as \\'living\\', so that, a quite literal translation might read: Holy God, Holy and Strong, Holy and Living, have mercy on us. In other words, what, in a grammatical sense, is wrong with this translation/train of thought? Caveats I am not Greek, I do not speak Greek.

If possible I\\'d also like to keep the final phrase as short as possible, similar to how the phrase is now. Thanks for any help or advice you can offer!', \"What does “non oportet” mean? When verbs that recommend an action to some degree (such as should, must, ought ) are negated, there are two possible interpretations: (a) the action is simply not recommended , nor anything else; or (b) it is recommended to desist from the action. In English, it depends on the verb which interpretation is correct, but for each verb it is generally unambiguous. For example: you should go → recommendation; you should not go → recommendation to stay you need to go → requirement; you need not go → simple absence of requirement, but go if you want Some expressions are ambiguous and the meaning depends on context, possibly even on intonation. All this raises the question how Latin's own oportere reacts to negation. In short, what does this sentence mean? Te ire non oportet. You must not go? You need not go? It is not self-evident, is it? To my surprise, the dictionaries I usually rely on are by and large not helpful. For example, Lewis & Short do not explicitly say how it works, and they give a few negated examples, but without translation. I think of the core meaning of oportet as being along the lines of “it is proper,” with the negation meaning “it is improper” (there being, in my mind, no middle ground). So it expresses a more or less strong recommendation to desist from the action, and the sentence above means “It is not proper that you go; you must not, ought not go” or something to that effect. But maybe I am wrong. I was made aware of this problem by a recent question asking for a Latin phrase for “it goes without saying.” A (since-deleted) answer suggested a phrase based on a quote by Thomas Aquinas, who said (Summa Theologiae 1, Q 52): Et secundum hoc patet quod non oportet dicere quod Angelus commensuretur loco. And sure enough, there is a translation that claims this means “there is no need for saying …” – I think this makes little sense in context, but then again this translation is actually officially sanctioned by the Catholic church.\", 'Semantic difference of ablative and accusative cases when following \"in\" What is the semantic and conceptual difference of ablative and accusative cases when following in ?

Favorem , malam , bonam , parem are in accusative. I fail to understand the supposed semantic, conceptual movement as opposed to status. How is par moving in par in parem ? How is reo static in in dubio pro reo ? In dubio pro reo is supposed to be a legal requirement addressing judgement. Judges are supposed to declare the defendant innocent in the event of doubt. One could say that the status of people is innocence and the requirement is to declare or maintain (negatively) the status (not to move / not to change the defendant\\'s status in case of doubt).', 'Can \"ad aliquid\" mean \"the same\"? Grimms\\' glossed German einschlägig thus: spectans, pertinens ad aliquid, bezüglich I was looking to understand what einschlägig means, which is only used in fixed expressions, and I\\'m afraid I didn\\'t get very far, but if you have to ask (if the gloss isn\\'t enlightening): For what it\\'s worth, W. Pfeifer and de.wiktionary agree, it can mean approximately: \"for the same purpose, in the same matter\". That is however not quite obvious from the older usage example in Grimm, nor from the glosses. Further elaboration is besides the point, though, cp. perhaps Grimms\\' entry at bezüglich . From en.wiktionary I can glean that aliquid is an inflected form of aliquis \"something\" (\"other\" + \"what\") Now it dawns on me that any sense of sameness might be conferred by the inflected construction with ad , as if \"of one thing\", \"pertaining to quite something else.\" Is that it?

In What are the key differences between the main Latin verbs meaning \"to kill\"? we saw a lot of verbs meaning \"to kill\" and the differences between them. The fun part of it is that I did not find the verb which originated the most common Spanish word with the same meaning: matar . This verb comes from Latin macto, āvi, ātum , which apparently means \"to slaughter, sacrifice\". So it seems that it was used for sacrifices, but I see that it also meant \"to offer\", \"to present, reward, honor\", \"to glorify\", \"to give splendor\" and finally \"to kill, put to death\". So: What was the main usage of this verb among the different ages of the language? Was it used then as a verb meaning \"to kill\" so as to be included in the list of the other question? Or did it mean something different, only used in sacrifices? Maybe it was more used as \"to offer something to the gods\"? Was it a common verb? I mean, Italian uccidere with the same meaning of \"to kill\" comes from Latin \" occīdo, cīdi, cīsum \" which actually is in the \"kill\" list of the other question, I was just wondering how the Spanish language (and Portuguese, it seems) ended up using this verb, but I will probably ask this in the Spanish site.', \"Does this Latin phrase convey a meaning?

This very first line, or part of a line, has me puzzled: looking around, most translations appear to favour \"The first golden age planted ... \"... but couldn\\'t it be \"The first age is planted with gold\"? Or maybe even the meaning \"hesitates\" between the two meanings (or more than two). A few thoughts occur: Perhaps Latin is stricter is use of tenses: in certain languages, e.g. French and to some extent English, you can use the present to mean the past, but maybe not in Latin. However, whichever way you interpret this first phrase, it appears that est will have to have a past meaning. Maybe there are also clues from just the way Latin-speakers habitually ordered their words, which at my level of pretty much beginner I won\\'t have any real idea of. To have two words of an ablative expression separated by an nominative adjective belonging to a later noun may also be unlikely, for all I know. And... I haven\\'t yet read thoroughly a few pages of the introduction of this book about metre of Ovid\\'s verse, but maybe clues come from that too, in the sense that the trailing \"a\" in aurea may or may not be a \"long\" \"a\", which may or may not indicate the case Ovid intends. I.e. if aurea is ablative, then (as I understand it) it must then have a long trailing \"a\". Hope someone can provide illumination!', \"What does Valerius Maximus mean in the line “eoque ictu origo et principium fortioris tragoediae extinctum est.”? Valerius Maximus, in Facta et Dicta Memorabilia , describes the death of Aeschylus ( V.Max. 9.12(ext).2 ): Aeschyli uero poetae excessus quem ad modum non uoluntarius, sic\\npropter nouitatem casus referendus. in Sicilia moenibus urbis, in qua\\nmorabatur, egressus aprico in loco resedit. super quem aquila\\ntestudinem ferens elusa splendore capitis—erat enim capillis\\nuacuum—perinde atque lapidi eam inlisit, ut fractae carne uesceretur, eoque ictu origo et principium fortioris tragoediae extinctum est. The Loeb translation reads: The poet Aeschylus’ departure was not voluntary, but the novelty of\\nthe occurrence makes it worth mention. He was in Sicily. Leaving the\\nwalls of the town where he was staying, he sat down in a sunny spot.\\nAn eagle carrying a tortoise was above him. Deceived by the gleam of\\nhis hairless skull, it dashed the tortoise against it, as though it\\nwere a stone, in order to feed on the flesh of the broken animal. By\\nthat blow the origin and beginning of more perfect tragedy was\\nextinguished. I am particularly interested in the translation of the final latin lines: eoque ictu origo et principium fortioris tragoediae extinctum est. Reading from the English translation, there is an ambiguity specifically in the phrasing “more perfect.” Is Maximus suggesting that Aeschylus's work was perfect and that, now being dead, he will no longer create further examples of perfect tragedies? Here, “more” being read quantitatively. Or, alternatively, do we read “more” as suggesting a qualitative distinction: Aeschylus death was itself the perfect tragedy?

If that is the case, where is the \"and\" I might reasonably expect for \"... AND a body (plural for singular) with variegated spots\"? Or... is it possible that corpora , although a n. pl. noun, is somehow able to function as a m. s. noun for the purposes of the participle/adjective stellatus ? This wouldn\\'t make all that much sense though, because it would then say \"the starred body has a name...\". Alternatively, if corpora is not the subect of habet , and in order to get to the Loeb meaning, somehow you would have to find the notion of \" with a body starred with variegated specks\". But corpora is either nom. or acc. and stellatus , as I say, must seemingly be nominative. NB I am aware (from a footnote in Loeb) that stellio is another word for \"lizard or newt\".

I am not a Latin expert and I found this site according to which the meaning of vagitus in Latin was “crying”, in a generic sense, not specific to the cry of a new born like in English.

This sentence comes from a letter by Cicero to Atticus written when the former is in exile. It can be found in Epistulae ad Atticum 3, 5: Ad te quid scribam nescio. I understand that \"nescio\" is the verb, meaning \"I don\\'t know\", \"I ignore\". Then, \"quid nescio\" would be \"I don\\'t know what\" and \"ad te\" can be interpreted as the preposition \"ad\" and the accusative pronoun \"te\", a complement which expresses finality meaning \"to you\", something similar to the dative pronoun \"tibi\". However, I don\\'t understand which is the role of \"scribam\" in this sentence.

Especially, in situations when people are angry or in hurry. In those cases, I wonder if several kinds of order would \"sound\" [not sure to whom though] odd/\"too poetical\". I've read that the order might be used to stress out certain words or the idea behind the sentence.
