The two main ""approaches"" are to extract the alcohol afterwards or just don't allow the generation of it.

The extracting part can be achieved by filtering and reverse osmosis. Alcohol and water are getting sucked out and the ""beer mass"" gets re-watered. These steps may affect the taste quit a bit. A few brewers (especially in Germany) have developed a ""top secret"" technique to brew a alcohol free beer which tastes the same as ""normal"" beer - but most of these are ""top secret"".

Latest science experiements revealed a new way of brewing alcohol free beer, by just stopping the fermentation process. This can be done by lowering the temperature of the liquid containers.

Beers brewed with this technique tend to taste more sweet.

Both method have their up and downs so a couple brewers combined both: Less fermentation than usual and extracting the extra bits of alcohol.

Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term ""top-fermenting"" is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. 

Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. *

Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as ""bottom"" yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented. 

Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.*

19,2,,2014-01-21T20:48:20.130,25,,"It depends on the beer really.  A good rule of thumb is darker beer should be served at a warmer temperature than lighter beer.

For instance if you refrigerate all of your beers and then pull them out of the fridge and drink them instantly you will miss A LOT of the flavor complexity of pretty much every stout and porter you put to your lips.

But, if you let the dark stuff warm up for just 15 minutes before you drink it (let it sit at room temp) a bunch of new flavors will appear that you never would have noticed otherwise.

This doesn't work so well, in my experience, for lighter beers like pilsner, lager, or hefe-weisen.  They really are meant to be drank cold and letting them get warm changes their flavor profile for the worse.

Obviously there will always be personal preferences but, at a minimum I encourage you to try letting your darker beers warm up just a bit and see what a positive difference it makes.

Here is a temperature guide from this article: Serving Temperature Guide. It categorizes different beers based on temps to serve at.  These are basic rules of thumb and again you'll want to experiment and discover what temps you like your beers at the best.

That said, how much of a difference it makes to you is what's important.  Going back to the wine comparison, I can sometimes tell the difference between different glasses, but not consistently.  So it's not the most important thing.

27,2,,2014-01-21T20:57:40.213,6,,"There are two main ways to carbonate beer. 

Force carbonation - This is where CO2 is forced into the fermented beer. Because of the pressure (and the temperature at which it is done) the CO2 will dissolve into the beer solution. The fizz that happens when you open a beer is the CO2 coming out of solution. (Technically you can re-carbonate flat beer!)

Natural carbonation - All beer has SOME yeast present. Home-brewers that bottle will actually pour a little bit of sugar into the racked beer before bottling. The yeast that is present will re-activate and eat the sugar. One of the bi-products is CO2. Because the beer is bottled and the CO2 has nowhere to go, it will dissolve into solution. This is why you will often see little yeast cakes in the bottom of home-brewer's bottles.

There are some beers that used forced-nitrogen to nitrogenate (if that is the appropriate word) their beers. 

TL;DR - Temperature, methods of carbonating, storing beer can all affect carbonation.

41,2,,2014-01-21T21:05:17.293,11,,"There are a few theories out there, and their veracity, like that of most historical ""facts"", is hotly debated.

One theory begins in 1722 when Ralph Harwood, a London brewer, created a beer called Entire.  For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  

Entire was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name porter came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that porter simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.

Another theory suggests that porter comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called poorter was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term poorter originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.

That said, it may be best to ask the brewer what the recommended shelf life is for any specific beer.

Mythbusters address this in episode 127 - http://mythresults.com/dirty-vs-clean-car - the rate of consumption is what matters, not the order

A hangover caused by beer is less severe than one caused by a mixture of beer and liquor.
BUSTED
To perform this test, Tory and Grant would have to eat the same food, drink their alcohol at the same time, and sleep for the same length of time in the warehouse for consistent results. Kari (who could not take part because of her pregnancy) then devised a battery of tests to measure dehydration, memory, light/sound/motion sensitivity, and coordination. Without having drunk alcohol, Tory and Grant performed well on their control test. They then performed the beer test, with Tory drinking 14 cans of beer and Grant drinking six. They both performed significantly worse than the control tests, signifying they were badly hung over. They then repeated the test with a mixture of beer and liquor, making sure to drink an equivalent amount of alcohol as in the first test. The next morning, Tory and Grant improved significantly and felt much better than in the previous test. Thus, the Build Team declared the myth busted.

NYTimes also addressed this back in 2006 - http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/07/health/the-claim-mixing-types-of-alcohol-makes-you-sick.html

&quot;The pattern, more often, is that people will have beer and then move on to liquor at the end of the night, and so they think it's the liquor that made them sick,&quot; he continued. &quot;But simply mixing the two really has nothing to do with it.&quot;


In general, the ABV of wine is higher than that of beer, so if you consume a higher ABV after a lower ABV, you will feel its effects faster, but if you're still drinking at the same rate, you won't notice you've had any effect as readily as if you drank at the slower rate more generally associated with the higher ABV beverage.

I know you can achieve lower alcohol content by using less yeast, or sugar, or both, since alcohol in beer is produced by the fermentation process of yeast turning sugar into alcohol. I would guess this is primarily how it's done, but there could be other (post-fermentation) processes of removing alcohol. (EDIT: according to Wikipedia, I'm totally wrong. Most low- or non-alcoholic beer is made by boiling off the alcohol.)

In terms of taste, lighter beers (in terms of alcohol content), generally taste, well, lighter. I like many higher-alcohol beers because the alcohol seems to bring out many of the more complex flavours in the beer, making it (in my opinion) more interesting. That's not to say that all strong beers are good or all light beers are bad, as there are many other things to consider. But I don't think it's possible to get the same complexity and flavour into a light 3.2% beer as it is in a stronger beer, in my experience anyway.

First, a stronger (higher ABV) beer will tend to cellar better, as the alcohol can act to help prevent oxidization.

Second, a beer with less emphasis on hops, and more on malt, yeast, or other characteristics, will be a better candidate, because the qualities that hops impart will fade in a fairly short time.  This is why your IPAs and such should be consumed sooner than later -- the character is primarily in the hops.

The purpose of cellaring a beer is to see its improvement over time.  Some may stay exactly the same, which others will change.  I think the answer there lies in whether there is still active yeast or bacteria in the bottle, and whether there is anything for them to chew on.

In particular, ""normal"" hopping is when you add hops while boiling the wort.  Depending on how much time you are into the boil, this may add more bitterness or more aroma.

Dry hopping, on the other hand, is when you add hops after the boil is done, usually in a fermentation chamber.  The purpose is only to add more aroma to a beer.  You aren't getting the oils from the hops, so the beer shouldn't be any more bitter than before.  Because no bitterness is added, you won't find a beer that is strictly dry-hopped -- the bitterness of the hops is what cuts the sweetness of the wort.  Dry hopping is an extra twist that some brewers use.

All that said, is there a way to tell whether a beer is dry-hopped or just extra hoppy?  That's hard to say, since you certainly can add more hops late in the boil to get more aroma qualities from them.

This kind of yeast evolved on rotting fruit, where there is plenty of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but no lactose, so they never needed the enzymes. There are other yeasts which can ferment lactose, but they aren't used in brewing, except by zany vodka makers and Mongols.

So, in a normal beer, potentially all of the sugar can be broken down during brewing. Whether it is or not is up to the brewer, who can stop the process while sugar remains, or let it run to completion. However, in a milk stout, there is no way for the lactose to be broken down, so it all remains at the end.

The amount of lactose in a milk stout varies, but it seems that it is likely to be in the range of 5 to 13%; that is, in a (568 millilitre) pint, there may be anywhere from 28 to 74 grams of lactose. The lactose concentration in milk is about 4%, so this is the equivalent of 700 - 1850 millilitres of milk. Rather a lot!

136,2,,2014-01-21T23:50:37.953,15,,"This is a broad question, notably regarding the differences between IPAs and Double IPAs, but here's an overview focusing on the naming (and misconceptions thereof) and brewing of variants.

Double IPA vs. Imperial IPA (IIPA)

First, the Double IPA is also known as an Imperial IPA (IIPA). You can think of the ""double"" as referring to the two letter I's :-) but the name actually owes itself to the beer having ""double"" the strength / hops.

IPA vs. Double IPA

The Double IPA generally uses more hops (though not literally ""double""), lengthier brewing processes (e.g. Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA, which is boiled for longer than its 60 Minute variant), sometimes secondary fermentation, etc. It has higher alcohol content, IPAs stopping around 7.5% ABV, while Double IPAs can soar to above 10%.

Double IPAs are claimed to have been started by the owner of the Russian River Brewing Company, famed for its flagship brew, Pliny the Elder, a Double IPA itself.

American Pale Ale (APA) vs. American IPA

The APA and American IPA are not synonymous. American Pale Ales are a derivative of (regular) British Pale Ales, deriving their own flavor from American hops, e.g. Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. American IPAs, meanwhile, are, of course, derived from actual (British) IPAs, and possess greater bitterness and higher alcohol content—examples include Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale and Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA. The line between APAs and IPAs blur (as do between many variants of ales), but categorically speaking, APAs are not IPAs.

IPA vs. Black IPA

The black IPA (also known by American Black Ale—and yes, a subset of the American IPA) uses dark roasted malts (used in porters and stouts) to achieve the color, while preserving hops characteristics. Some consider the black IPA more of a hoppy porter instead—and don't believe the style will be formally recognized (e.g. by the Brewers Association).

The ""skunky"" beer is actually lightstruck. This is exactly what it says: the beer has been damaged by light, such as sunlight or florescent light. When UV lights penetrate the glass of a beer bottle, they mess with the chemical makeup of some acids produced by the hops. The result is a new compound called methyl mercaptan, which is one of the components of the defense mechanisms found in the skunk.

This is prevented by packaging beer in brown bottles, which is better protected from UV rays. Unfortunately, this lets those green rays get in, which makes sense as to why some beers are served with lime: it keeps away the ""skunky"" smell for a while.

In reality, it doesn't take much to spoil your beer. If your beer in a green or clear bottle has not already been spoiled before it got to the store, about a minute's worth of exposure to the sun would do it.

As explained by George de Piro, a biochemist and Brewmaster of C. H. Evans Brewing Company—


  When light hits beer, it provides the energy necessary to drive a reaction that transforms the iso-alpha-acids into 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol. The “thiol” part of that somewhat cumbersome name indicates that there is sulfur present. Sulfur compounds often have strong, offensive aromas. Some musteline animals, like skunks, have evolved the ability to produce this chemical, and use it for self-defense. [...] This photochemical reaction is the only cause of skunked beer. Warm storage, while damaging to the flavor of beer, does not skunk it. Cycling the temperature of beer from warm to cold and back again is also not implicated. Storing beer in the dark is the simple way to prevent skunking.


It's actually pretty amazing how quickly this reaction can happen! From the same article,


  The photochemical reaction that skunks beer occurs very quickly; a well-hopped beer in clear glass can become noticeably offensive with just 30 seconds of exposure to sunshine. 


To wrap it up,


  Since light is an essential ingredient in the skunking process, beers packaged in kegs, cans, and opaque bottles cannot be skunked.

Fractional freezing -- ""jacking"" in old parlance -- has a long history in the United States. The beverage applejack was produced using this method by first fermenting apple juice into hard apple cider. Then barrels of this cider were left outside during the winter and the connoisseur would occasionally fish out the frozen chunks of water, leaving an ever-concentrated batch of hard alcohol behind. At some point in the 20-25 percent ABV range, the liquor would stop freezing at ambient temperatures and the booze was ready to consume as ""Jersey Lightning."" It was also used as currency.

Moving into the malt-beverage world, brewers in Germany use fractional freezing to make eisbock. These brews are usually just regular bock beers, which clock in at 6 percent ABV, freeze-concentrated to something in the 13 percent ABV range. Frankly, there are probably easier ways to get high-proof beers (make a barleywine, for example) than by starting with a mid-strength one and concentrating it, but there's a market for eisbocks and it's possible to find them in the US as well. A more infamous set of freeze-concentrated beers was made by the Scottish brewery BrewDog in their quest to make ""the strongest beer in the world."" The first was Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a beer that started with an ABV in the teens and ended at 32 percent ABV. Then a little brewing war started up between BrewDog and German brewery Schorschbräu to make ever-stronger beers. Schorschbräu made a Schorschbock at 40 percent ABV, BrewDog countered with Sink the Bismarck at 41 percent ABV. Then came another beer at 55 percent ABV (that's 110 proof, my friends). Schorschbräu is current record-holder with Schorschbock 57, at 57 percent ABV.

145,2,,2014-01-22T04:23:10.133,3,,"Sort of.

There are literally dozens of different varieties of hops, in much the same way there are dozens of different breeds of dogs. Just as a Chihuaua and a Great Dane are both Canis Lupus, a Galena Hop and a Goldings Hop are bot Humulus Lupulus, separated by vastly different lineages and genetics. New hop varieties are often developed by selective crossbreeding of existing variants, to generate different flavor profiles by adjusting the acidity and oil content of the hop.

Like different breeds of dogs, different hop varieties are often the products of hundreds of years of genetic development in a particular climate -  the Pacific Northwest, especially the Yakima Valley and Cascade Mountains in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, is known for it's production of very strong, highly acidic hops that impart a very strong bitter flavor - take a sip of a Sierra Nevada IPA and you'll instantly recognize that classic blend of the 'three C's'.

By contrast, traditional hops grown in England and on the European continent tend to be more mellow and aromatic - especially the so called 'noble hops' popular in many less bitter tasting German and Czech beers. Still others, like Japans Sorachi Ace, offer a more citrus bite to the beer they're added to. While these differences are not directly a product of climate, it's doubtless true that climate has had an impact on the development of variation amongst the various hop lines that have been bred through the centuries -  and especially over the past 50 years or so.

Put another way: New World vs. Old World Hops is a meaningful distinction, but it has less to do with climate and more to do with the difference in cultivation practices and the specific varietals popular with farmers in various regions. Growing conditions may have some impact, but the specific lineage matters much, much more. The fact that those lineages tend to have significant geographic commonalities is as much an accident of history as it is of varying conditions, but it's nonetheless sufficiently meaningful that, in particular referring to hops from the Pacific Northwest evokes a very specific and comprehensible flavor profile in most educated beer drinkers.

Hops are mildly sedative.  It isn't unreasonable to think that very hoppy beers may have a different effect than less hoppy beers.
Gruit beers (unusual but there are some on the market!) often have other psychoactive ingredients in them too.  With historical brewing becoming a bit of an industry, it may only be a matter of time before we see commercially available henbane beer too....
Alcohol absorption will be retarded by carbohydrate content in the beer.  You will absorb alcohol more slowly from a heavy beer than a light beer.
Carbonation works the other way.  Lightly (or rarely available uncarbonated) beers will affect one more slowly than highly carbonated beers.  For most commercial beers this is not a significant factor but for home-brewed beers or specialty beers it may be.

Beers with disparate sharp contrasts (particularly where fruit are involved) may benefit from aging.  I could imagine things like full-bodied apricot ales aging well.
Higher ABV and richer beers are likely to age better than lower ABV and lighter beers.

Letting alone ethanol, which triggers innumerable biochemical pathways in our bodies, hops itself may affect potency and sexual desire, in males at least, but there appears to be few clinical studies supporting this claim directly. Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn't testosterone (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather its interaction with estrogen, produced from testosterone through a process known as aromatization.1 So it's not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.

I'm certainly not qualified to deliver conclusions myself, but I can at least point to some of the important studies from which current (mis)conceptions have derived.

1: Wu, M. V. et al. Estrogen Masculinizes Neural Pathways and Sex-Specific Behaviors. 2009. [PDF]

Why some claim that hops decreases sex drive...

Hops contains phytoestrogens,


  substances that promote estrogenic actions in mammals and structurally are similar to mammalian estrogen 17&beta;-estradiol (E2) [...]


Ososki, A. L. and Kennelly, E. J. Phytoestrogens: a Review of the Present State of Research. 2003. [PDF]

Specifically,


  a recurring suggestion has been that hops have a powerful estrogenic activity and that beer may also be estrogenic. [...] We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens.


Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (Humulus lupulus L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]

However, it's worth noting that the same paper concludes,


  [...] despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to ""estrogens in beer"" are to be expected.


Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:


  8-Prenylnaringenin alone competed strongly with 17&beta;-estradiol for binding to both the &alpha;- and &beta;-estrogen receptors.


Milligan, S. R. et al. The endocrine activities of 8-prenylnargingenin and related hop (Humulus lupulus L.) flavonoids. 2000. [PDF]

(In case one is unfamiliar with how receptors work, receptors ""catch"" freestanding compounds in a medium such as the bloodstream, thereby reducing their effects. The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself ""caught"" by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it'd normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)

...but it's not that simple!

Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can't be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn't be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like ""potency,"" ""sex drive,"" and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!

As a very example of the latter, one site [link] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to ""prove"" that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I'm not saying beer doesn't, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, ""blocks testosterone,"" when in fact the very paper it cites says (in its abstract nonetheless),


  Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen.

On top of all this, ethanol affects so many parts of the brain via so many chemical pathways—what's even the significance of 8-prenylnarigenin or Xanthohumol when stacked against ethanol? Do you know?—I sure don't—and probably no one does—else it'd have been stated by researchers themselves, without the ""help"" of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.

In conclusion,

I'm not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily wrong—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation). What I am saying is that they can't be right-by-science, as currently available research seems extremely domain-specific, incomplete in larger perspectives, and therefore not generalizable.



Addendum

The study by Ososki and Kennelly also states


  As potential endocrine disrupters, phytoestrogens may act as antiestrogens and harm the reproductive health of males (Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 1993; Santti et al., 1998). Reduced sperm quality, undescended testes and urogenital tract abnormalities were increased in the sons of mothers taking DES compared with those who did not take the miscarriage preventative drug [...]


This statement is initially misleading as it says ""males"" instead of ""developing males""—a fact not made clear until the following sentence. From the studies it cites (emphasis mine),


  We argue that the increasing incidence of reproductive abnormalities in the human male may be related to increased oestrogen exposure in utero, and identify mechanisms by which this exposure could occur.


Sharpe, R. M. and Skakkebaek, N. E. Are oestrogens involved in falling sperm counts and disorders of the male reproductive tract? 1993. [URL]


  Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) induces persistent structural and functional alterations in the developing reproductive tract of males.

174,2,,2014-01-22T09:36:46.120,8,,"More than a millenia ago, there were few standardized recipies for herbs to add during the beer brewing process.  ""Gruit"" referred to the herbal mixtures used to flavor and preserve beer.  Gruit was usually sold under papal license exclusive to certain areas at various monasteries and therefore represented a monopoly in Christian areas of the Catholic Church.  Traditionally it included plants such as yarrow, mugwort, henbane, sweet gale, bog rosemary, juniper, and more.  Some of these survive in gin recipes.

Why gruit has largely been replaced by hops is a fascinating and divisive historical question.  There may however have been a number of factors including the possibility (largely untested) that hops beers kept longer and the rising concern by Protestant (and even Catholic) nobles of the power of the economic power that this gave Catholic institutions.  What is known is that a campaign was waged against gruit and the purported (and likely actual) mind altering properties of it.  The use of gruit was more or less entirely supplanted by hops.

More recently some breweries have been experimenting with gruit beers for national pride and/or historical reasons.  These include Fraoch and Alba from the Williams Brothers in Scotland, and a few other examples. They are not common however and are certainly specialty beers today.  Additionally the gruits used in commercial beers are pretty tame by historical standards.  I haven't found any including herbs like henbane (which was one of the historical staples of brewing, used even more prevalently than hops is today).

Fermentation of grain is universal, as is fermentation of fruit and honey. You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.

Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can't digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:


malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn't work for rice.
helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian ""Tape"" (rice or cassava ""beer"" or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).
Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.


South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.

The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.

As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It's very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).

If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don't know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine's time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English ""beor"" means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn't get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don't think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.

Now as for lager, these are far more recent.

Finally as a note, until maybe a hundred years ago, before modern capping and beer cans, most beer would have been sold uncarbonated, but speciality beers were carbonated much like champagne is today.  My own home brewing experiments (I even brew as a history nut) with non-carbonated beers suggest that they are of an altogether different character than carbonated ones (owing to the carbonic acid in carbonated drinks).  The flavors are lighter, sweeter, brighter, and more distinct, and entirely different than ""flat"" beer.  This is because dissolved carbon dioxide imparts extra acidity to beer.

EDIT:  It also occurs to me that controlled fermentation is one of the most common ways of preserving foods in the pre-industrial ages.  This includes lactic fermentation (that gives us shelf-stable cheese, salami, sauerkraut, etc), but also alcoholic fermentation must be included there too.  There's no reason to think that the first fermented grains were fermented by accident.

A grain, somehow modified to ferment with yeast (see below)
Water
Yeast
Other additives to impart flavor and help preserve the brew (hops or gruit usually).


The grains are usually malted but note that rice doesn't malt using the normal process, so typically with rice beers you have some other process for extracting starches (most typically you have another culture which breaks down starches into sugars).  Grains historically used in brewing include:


barley (the standard today)
rye
wheat
rice (most common in Asia).
corn
millet  (common in Africa and probably early Asia before being supplanted by rice)
oats
buckwheat


For the other additives, the most common is hops, but other ones in commercial brewing include:


heather flowers
alecost
pine needles
spruce needles
sweet gale
juniper berries
Grains of paradise


Historically the following were also added, but not so much anymore.  Experienced, adventuresome, and/or foolish home-brewers may use these (foolish, if they do this without some understanding or experience of the potential ramifications):


mugwort 
henbane (this was historically a really, really big one but has signficant toxicity and contraindications medically)
bog rosemary


I have experimented with gruits containing the following which are not historically attested to my knowledge:


damask rose petals (gruit also containing hops)
lavender (probably would be great with juniper berries but didn't have any)


Sometimes fruit and/or honey is also added.  Sometimes corn sugar (fructose) is added.  I have also seen other flavoring like garlic and chili peppers added to beer.

Sometimes animal products are included.  Historically the big ones were milk, whey, and chicken broth.  Today, however, those ones are rarely if ever used.  There are cases of oyster broth added, as well as isinglass (made from swim bladders of fish).  Sometimes icelandic moss (an algae) is added as a clarifying agent.

That should be a fairly complete list however assuming you aren't going further afield into other traditional malt liquors.

The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery,
either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.
The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and
it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way
of life
The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture.  The
income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance
of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to
charity for social work and to help persons in need.


There are some standardized naming conventions, for instance the Double (orginally used by Westmalle) is a brown ale which has an alcohol level of around 7%. 

The Tripple is another name first used by Westmalle, which are often blond and have an alcohol level of about 8% to 10%.

Orval has a very traditional and unique brewing process which involves
 the use of dry hopping, in which large meshed bags of hops infuse the beer during the three-week maturation period. The other is the use of Brettanomyces yeast during this same maturation, which are a local wild yeast. Hallertau, Styrian Goldings and French Strisselspalt hops are used. The beer is then matured at 15°C for a minimum of four weeks on site before being distributed.

If drunk right after bottling it has a ""young"" fresh flavor. The beer can be preserved for several years as it re-ferments once bottled. Even 35 year old Orval is still drinkable, if preserved at the right temperature. After about 1 year of preservation the beer flavor changes to a softer, sweeter and more intense experience compared to the young one.

There are two versions of Orval, one is the normal one which can be bought in the stores and then there is also a special Petite Orval, which can only be drunk at the Orval abbey and is only produced for the Monks (no mass sale). Its alcohol percentage is a lot lower than the normal Orval.

Although, this isn't universal. I wonder if this is just a marketing technique (it needs a bottle opener so it must be good).

In my opinion it's more about tradition than functionality. Just as with french wines plastic corks can actually provide a more durable seal than metallic caps or real corks as they are less susceptible to decay due to moist. However in the spirit of the tradition and to keep customers happy it's often a less preferred option.

For instance, Belgium is a fairly traditional country and you will often never find plastic beer bottles or twist-top caps. Not because they are up to the task, but just because the Belgians didn't like it.

It can be influinced and is often influenced during the brewing process, by adding sugar (which gets transformed into alcohol) at certain phases during the brewing process. Several beers first get brewn on a barrel and then after a few weeks put onto a bottle after which sugar may be added. Adding the sugar causes a seconds fermentation which will result in a higher alcohol level. 

Often deeper tastes as experienced with for instance a La Trappe, Rocherfort 10 or Westvleteren are the effect of the higher alcohol level. While alcohol certainly plays a role in the beer's taste, spices and herbs are also important for the beer's taste body.

Younger beers can have sediment as well, but can still be drunk. The beer will get a more bittre taste if sediment is poured a long as well.  

Speed is also important, depending on the temperature of the beer, it can foam more. There are beers which have their own specifc pooring prescription. Some beers like Duvel actually need to be ""dumped"" into the glass with a vertical poor. Others like Guiness use a double poor.

  Most well known of all the mulled beers was Wassail. Recipes for this holiday favorite vary, but all were based upon the same basic formula. Sugar was placed in the bottom of a bowl, one pint of warm beer was then poured in along with nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.


Smith, G. ""Mulled beer."" [URL]

One mulls beer by simmering beer in a pan, nearly always with the following ingredients:


ginger
nutmeg
cinnamon
cloves
honey, agave nectar, or sugar


but also sometimes adding


egg yolk
cardamon
star anise
coriander
black pepper
allspice berries


and occasionally garnishing the drink with orange rinds. The mixture should be brought to a simmer but not a boil, and heated for 5 to 10 minutes depending on the recipe.

Some even refer to warmed beer as ""mulled"" beer, i.e. beer heated it in its bottle in a pot (or slowcooker) filled with water. For this case, there is not a consensus on the heating temperature, as it appears to vary according to the beer:


  Mulled beer needs to be heated slowly. A slow-cooker half-filled with water works well. Just open the bottle and stand it in the uncovered appliance. I also have used a large pot on the stove, with the burner on low. Don't let the water to get anywhere close to boiling -- 130 to 140 degrees is ideal. It's also important to keep the water level constant, so replace the water as it evaporates.


Brooks, J. R. ""Brooks on Beer: Hot, Mulled Beer?"" 2011. [URL]


  Before serving, you warm the opened bottle [of Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes' La Dragonne] in a pot of hot water to raise the ale's temperature to about 110 degrees.

Tips:

The precise answer to the question &quot;How long does beer last?&quot; depends to a large extent on storage conditions - store beer in cool, dark area.
Keep beer away from direct sources of heat or light; too much exposure to light can cause beer to develop a foul taste.
To maximize the shelf life of beer, store beer at a temperature between 45° F and 55° F (colder than the typical room temperature, but warmer than a refrigerator) - if this is not possible, store beer in the refrigerator.
Storage times shown are for best quality only - after that, the beer's color or flavor may change, but in most cases, it will still be safe to consume if it has been stored properly.

Here is where the additional alcohol comes in:  To counteract the extra bitterness, the beers that have boiled longer have both additional malt added to balance the bitterness, and are given additional fermentation and conditioning time to allow the yeast to convert all of those malt sugars into alcohol.  In 120 Minute IPA's case, it spends an entire month in fermentation, resulting in an exceptionally high level of alcohol at the end.

Beer is also alcohol
That is directly from wikipedia:

Men's sexual behaviors can be affected dramatically by alcohol. Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most (but not all) studies to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.
As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency. Alcohol intoxication can decrease sexual arousal, decrease pleasureability and intensity of orgasm, and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.

Since wikipedia show related soruce of that info and most of them are clinical research, we can say that alcohol have a negative effect on men.

In many women, alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, although it does lower the physiological signs of arousal. Women have a different response to alcohol intoxication. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption tends to cause increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Since testosterone controls in part the strength of libido in women, this tends to cause an increase in interest in sex. Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women’s bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.
Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm. Some women report a greater sexual arousal with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph, which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.

Different from men, we can say alcohol have more pros beside few cons for women.
Beer and couples
Men
Beer is probably the least powerful aphrodisiac alcoholic drink. The alcohol percentage in beer is low, meaning that more liquid has to be consumed to raise men's testosterone levels to hit that &quot;comfortable&quot; level. Most beers are very nourishing and filling, and when too many of them are consumed, they can create an unpleasant stomachache. Drinking too much beer will make men go to the washroom more often, as well as create a bloating sensation. The effects of being bloated surely don't entice sexual encounters and won't lead men to seek out sexual opportunities. Yet, some special beers have a local reputation for increasing libido, but even with that, beer is not the best choice for men.
Women
While hops in beer will have a negative impact on men’s hormonal balance, it may actually be positive for women. Hops has aphrodisiac-like qualities for women, as because of the phytoestrogen it contains, which mimic natural estrogen. Low sex drive in women is often cause by low levels of estrogen.
Consuming beer, especially hop-rich varieties like IPA, could actually help restore hormonal balance and help with libido and also alleviate menopausal symptoms of fatigue, irritability and hot flashes

Boiling effectively stops the process of converting starches into sugars which the yeast can turn into alcohol by destroying enzymes in the malt.  Therefore once you are boiling, this process has stopped.  Boiling affects hops, by boiling off the aroma and extracting more of the organic acids that provide bitterness.

What does affect abv is the period of time the wort is kept warm before boiling.  This time and temperature affects how much of the starches convert and therefore trades between body and abv.  Boiling fast means you have a lot of body and low alcohol.  Boiling later means you have more abv and a lot less body.

The bitterness of the beer isn't just down to the quantity of alpha acids, which is what the IBUs measure. The bitterness is offset by any residual sweetness in the beer.

A brewer can brew two different beers with the same IBUs, and them taste different. For example, with two beers with 20 IBUs - one might taste balanced between sweet and bitter, while the other one just tastes sweet. Another pair of beers with 70 IBUs, one might be unpleasantly bitter, while the other a more balanced kind bitter, or even simply neutral. The FG can give you some insight into these differences, but it's still not going to be precise.

Frankly the best way to know how the bitterness of the beer plays with the rest of the beer qualities is to read the label for any subjective descriptive text, or simply buy it and taste it.

For draught systems that directly push the beer, there are these gasses in common use:


air - such as with a hand-pump
CO2 - homebrewers and short runs
N2 - for creamflow beers or where the beer line is longer than 50'.
A mix of N2 and CO2


Using air to push the beer doesn't have any immediate affect on taste. However, after a few hours the oxygen in the air will start to stale the beer, causing staling flavors, and a muted hop aroma. 

Using CO2 to push the beer can cause the beer to have more ""fizz"" and in extreme cases more carbonic bite.

For long beer lines, N2 is used to overcome the carbonation problem with CO2. 

A combination of N2 and CO2, typically in the ratio 75%/25% is used for Guinness and creamflow beers. When used in conjunction with a stout or creamer faucet, this has a definite affect on the flavor and appearance of the beer - bitterness is rounded out and the beer has a thicker mouthfeel. When the beer is poured, the faucet and gas pressure cascades of bubbles to form when poured in the glass, which produce a lovely thick dense head of foam on top of the glass. With this type of serving, it's key to have a relatively low amount of dissolved CO2, or the glass will be filled with foam only.

If this were tried with a regularly carbonated beer, you'd end up with foam erupting out of the can. Hence, beers packaged with a widget have only about 1/3 the carbon dioxide dissolved than regular beers, plus the nitrogen, which creates a smooth mouthfeel and dense foam. Due to the requirements of reduced carbon-dioxide, the widget is used almost exclusively with Stouts, Bitters and Irish Red ales - styles that can be served with lower volumes of carbon-dioxide.

252,2,,2014-01-23T06:54:13.143,10,,"The calories in beer come mainly from the alcohol and the carbohydrates in the beer. By reducing either or both of these, the beer will become lighter. As well as being lighter in calories, light beers are typically lighter in taste also.

Alcohol is reduced by starting with a lower amount of sugar in the wort (lower OG.) By fermenting less sugar, less alcohol is produced. The carbohydrates in beer are so-called residual sugars. These are reduced by reducing the amount of non-fermentable sugars, such as by adjusting the recipe to avoid malts that contain unfermentable sugars (such as Cara/Crystal malts, and highly kilned malts). Also the brewer can adjust the temperature that the grains are mashed to produce a more fermentable wort with less residual sugar.

To see how alcohol and carbs affect the calories in beer, here's an excerpt from this table that lists the % abv, grams of carbohydrates in a 12.oz serving:

Name        Brewer          abv     cal.    carbohydrates
Busch Ice   Anheuser Busch  5.9%    169 12.5g     
Busch Light Anheuser Busch  4.1%    95  3.2g


The light beer has considerably less calories than the regular beer. In fact, around 80% of the calories in that beer come from the alcohol:

1 g of alcohol = 7 kcal. 

1 g of carbohydrate = 4 kcal.

Volume of beer is 12oz. x 28.6g = 343ml.  Volume of alcohol is 4.1 % x
343 = 14 ml

To convert alcohol volume to weight, divide by 1.25. Weight of alcohol
is 14 / 1.25 = 11.2g 


So


  Energy from alcohol is 11.2 x 7 = 78.4 kcal. As percent: 78.4/95 =
  82% 
  
  Energy from carbs is 3.2 x 4 = 12.8. As percent: 12.8/95 = 13%


(The total is less than 100% - the data doesn't account for protein, which is typically about 1g/12oz, which is about 4 kcal.)

By brewing the beer with an even lower %abv, the beer would be even lighter in calories, but possibly at the expense of flavor.

253,2,,2014-01-23T08:00:41.727,9,,"For a keg system to pour beer without excessive foam, the system must be balanced, and the serving line/faucet free of obstructions. Serving beer at too high a pressure, or through a half-open faucet/tap agitates the beer, causing the foam you saw. 

The system is balanced by having the pressure inside the keg set to just a touch more (0.5-1psi) than the pressure resistance outside the keg. The pressure resistance outside the keg comes from the beer line and the tap - the longer the beer line, the more resistance. Also any increase in height between the keg and the end of the tap will increase resistance.

But even if the system was originally balanced, with the right dispensing pressure or adequate length of beer line, there are still some things working against you:


if the keg has been sloshed about, some of the carbon dioxide will have come out of the beer and into the headspace, creating more pressure. It takes several days for this to equalize again.
as the keg warms, the pressure inside the keg increases, since gas has a higher pressure at higher temperature with the same volume.


If you have a keg that is overpressured, you have 3 basic options:


reduce the pressure inside the keg by venting some of the gas. Some kegs have a pressure relief valve that can be pulled to reduce pressure. But do it in small bursts, and try the beer after each until you see that the beer comes out not to quickly.
increase the resistance outside the keg by using a longer beer line and/or placing the keg somewhere low and serving the beer higher. (e.g. keg at ground level and stand up to serve the beer.)
dispense a large amount beer to a large jug - removing beer from the keg will reduce the pressure in the keg, and keeping it in a jug gives time for the head on the beer to settle down. While you're waiting, just pour some more beer from the keg - this will come out slower and have less foam.

There are two important factors I see, looking at this as a history nut but not knowing of any sources on this topic.  The first, as you say, is widespread refrigeration.  But this was not the major factor in cold beverages generally since ice was often preserved into the summer for cooling beverages (and has been since ancient times).  But refrigeration makes this easier and thus cheaper.

The second is actually the modern bottlecap which is a product of industrialization.  Before the bottlecap most beers were served uncarbonated.  They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.

To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.  I think this also helps explain why richer beers are more often served warm than lighter beers.

While hops were used in medicine, the major national herbals of Anglo-Saxon England don't mention them.  That we have strong references in early 8th century England (see ""Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink"" by Ann Hagen) to comparatively large-scale cultivation of hops strongly suggests they were used in brewing.

Hops are used in medicine as well, but the amounts used there are very small in comparison to those used for brewing, and the two major Anglo-Saxon national herbals, Bald's Leechbook and The Lacnunga don't mention them (I think the Old English Herbarium does, but it is a translation into Old English of a continental Latin work).  Keep in mind most of my work with these has been in translation (Pollington's) and translating plants from the descriptions often poses interesting issues.  I could probably find standarized editions in Old English if needed however.

One of the interesting connections here is that two of the most important early brewing herbs, hops and henbane, both had strong connections to female medical concerns (this is also interesting because historically brewing was women's work, hence the obsolete term ""alewife"" not referring to a fish--- the woman's place in keeping a tavern was privileged but brewing was sort of like cooking, something every woman was supposed to know).  Hops to heavy periods, and henbane was used to address pain in childbirth.  Both of these may contribute to Bald's warning that pregnant women may drink ale safely but not beer, for beer would cause a risk of miscarriage.

In general for hops to be grown to an extent noteworthy, one is almost certainly talking about brewing, whether grains or honey, and whether alone or with other herbs.

Heat your wort with water, steep, then add hops and boil, add more hops as you begin to cool, once cool enough add yeast, ferment, bottle.

Seeds and roots would usually be added before the boil; herbs would usually be added after.  I would probably add fruit after but this is something that folks could argue about forever.  If you buy something like smoke-flavored beer, chili flavored beer, etc. these are probably made this way.

There's a second type of flavored beer I have seen for sale in certain bars and restaurants in Asia though.  That's where you take a fairly light beer on tap and add it to a glass along with a shot of flavoring syrup (like lychee or peach).  These usually have sweeter flavor with clearer fruit flavors than the fermented fruit beers.  If the beer is pasteurized, the flavoring could be added before bottling and carbonation.

What you have is a malt beverage. (You can see this in the small print on malt beverages such as SweetWater Blue for example)

Edit: (This is controversial and certainly not enforced)

There are tons of flavors you can impart based on the types of hops and malts you use and when you add them in the brewing process.

When boiling the wort, you can add hops to impart flavor midway through the process. If you add them at the beginning, you get bitterness primarily from the hops. If you add them at the end, you get primarily aroma from the hops.

It is common practice to add hops in all 3 stages for those reasons.

There's also a lot of flavor that you can add to the beer by aging it in barrels. It is common to use barrels from whiskey or bourbon for this purpose among craft brewers. This can add a huge punch of flavor in some beers. (This may be happening on in the Rogue beer you linked to)

267,2,,2014-01-23T16:41:41.700,7,,"The Rogue Voodoo Doughnut Maple Bacon Ale is an interesting example because the ingredients list shows two different ways flavors can be imparted to beer.  The smoky bacon flavor comes both from the actual inclusion of bacon and from the smoked malt: Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt, Weyermann Beechwood Smoked Malt, House-smoked Hickory Malt.  As discussed in Does chocolate stout contain real chocolate?, certain flavors can be achieved through the malting process rather than through additional ingredients.  Similarly maple is fermentable and could be added directly to boost alcohol content and impart a more subtle maple flavor.

That said, this beer does contain actual bacon and ""maple flavor"".  To get a look at and when and how the flavors are added, we can look at this clone recipe. 

Name              Amount     Time        Use
Fenugreek         0.25 oz    5.0 min     Boil
Maple Extract     1.0 oz     6.0 days    Primary
Bacon, cooked     4.0 oz     0.0 days    Bottle


Here, fenugreek is added during the boil phase, while creating the wort.  The boiling helps extract the flavor from the herb.  Maple extract gets added later during fermentation.  Maple extract or syrup could be used, but syrup is more expensive and fermentable so a stronger maple flavor is being achieved with extract.  The official ingredient list calls for ""Pure Maple Flavoring"" so I assume the same is being done there.  Lastly the bacon is being added at the end.  This is to add direct flavoring to the beer without interfering in the fermentation process.

270,2,,2014-01-23T18:11:23.213,34,,"Beer was commonly drunk in the middle ages (and renaissance), but what they drank is different from the beer we're used to today.

Beer and ale, being grain-based, were important dietary staples -- it's said that beer is liquid bread, and that's not far off.  For the common man (not nobility), in particular, grain made up a substantial part of the diet, with meat being fairly rare.  (Will try to update later with a friend's research on amount of grain/household consumed in medieval England, but it's substantial.)

Common beer was not aged for months or years like some beers today; rather, a batch might be produced in as little as half a week.  These are ""small beers"" (or ""small ales"", for the unhopped variety), which are mildly alcoholic but drinkable in volume without unfortunate effects.  These small beers/ales were produced in the home/manor; it was just one more task for the cooks.  (See, for example, Markham's The English Housewife, 1615 -- so that's rnnaissance not medieval, but is consistent with earlier cooking sources I've seen.)

I'm not aware of exceptions being made for pregnant women and small children.  Arguing from absence of evidence is risky, but I've worked with a variety of medieval and renaissance cookbooks and the occasional medicinal source, and I haven't seen anything along the lines of ""drinks for the pregnant and young"".

Modern beer, however, has little in common with the drink that carried that name through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Looking at a time when beer was often a nutritional necessity, was sometimes used as medicine, could be flavored with everything from the bark of fir trees to thyme and fresh eggs, and was consumed by men, women, and children alike...
It was the beverage of choice of urban populations that lacked access to secure sources of potable water; a commodity of economic as well as social importance; a safe drink for daily consumption that was less expensive than wine; and a major source of tax revenue for the state.
Unger describes the transformation of the industry from small-scale production that was a basic part of housewifery to a highly regulated commercial enterprise dominated by the wealthy and overseen by government authorities.

I have heard of people washing their hair with it, believing it helps promote healthy hair and scalp.
Heavy, high starch beers, have long been used as a food source for fasting monks, sort of a liquid bread.
Beer is commonly used for cooking certain things because the alcohol (as with wine) helps bring out certain flavors.


Additionally I want to mention something I use it for.  This works for me because of very specific reasons and I am not recommending that anyone else try it.  However, I get asthma frequently following upper respiratory illnesses (I have since I was a teenager).  I have a couple of alternative medical strategies for dealing with this depending on what is available.  Note, if you have asthma, don't take medical advice from me: asthma can be life threatening.  Work with a doctor.   However, among other things, I find that drinking a number of drinks of beer or wine for two nights in a row will cause the asthma to clear up until I get sick again.  This naturally works best when I am not otherwise consuming alcohol, but it allows me to be mostly medication free regarding my asthma (doing this two to three times a year).  Again this has a bunch of risks, so I am mentioning it just for informational purposes.  In general anything medical deserves a great deal of respect because what can cure can kill.

Also some kinds of traditional beer have very specific health benefits.  In Indonesia, ""tape hitam"" (black rice beer, consumed with the lees as a sort of soup) is generally understood to reduce blood cholesterol.

However, those are mostly the result of differences in the impurities in the alcohol (that is, all the non-alcohol stuff that differentiates beer from wine from vodka).  And for those differences, it's largely the difference between different types of liquor.

Beer is, compositionally, pretty much the same.  There might be enough difference between a heavy chocolate stout and a hoppy IPA, but between different brands of lighter beers (like pilsners), there's unlikely to be a noticeable difference in hangovers barring a weird food allergy to a minor element of one pilsner vs another.

Some far more likely causes of your friends reporting worse hangovers for different brands of the same beer type are:


Different quantities between evenings.  One evening you drank 10 Pilsner Urquells and the next you drink 8 Beck's.  How well are you really counting at that point?  If you think you had ""about 9 beers"" both nights, you might blame the worse hangover on Pilner Urquell.
Differences in alcohol level between brands.  The difference between 3.8% and 4.2% adds up after a while.
Small sample size.  Would you rely on a medical study of only 3 or 4 people?  Probably not.  Likewise, if your friend reports getting a bad hangover the last 3 or 4 times they drank Konig, it may just be a bit of coincidence, and they would have had a nasty hangover those nights regardless of what they drank.

I read somewhere about making ice cubes from beer somewhere, so that they don't dilute your beer (you need a good freezer for that though). I can't vouch if they don't affect the taste though.

A smart method though, is to use the buffer beer. Remove the ""buffer beer"" from the fridge, put the the lukewarm beer in the fridge, drink the buffer beer - meanwhile the beer you put in the fridge becomes your new buffer beer ;)

edit: if you go with reusable ice cubes, use ones that contain water inside. Don't buy in to the scam of granite ice cubes or solid steel ice cubes. Their thermal capacity is abysmal. To provide the amount of temperature drop a single normal ice cube provides, you'd need to fill your glass with granite cubes to nearly the brim.

Beer glassware serves a few primary purposes:


it is part of the branding of the beer (for beers with their own glass)
it presents the beer (beauty is in the eye of the beer holder) showcasing the beer's color, clarity and/or carbonation.
it influences how quickly volatiles (aromatics) are released
it influences how much beer can be consumed per sip (e.g. compare champagne flute vs. beer mug)
it can promote head retention (through the shape, plus small etchings in the base of the glass)


Some examples


A Pilsner glass is a long tall V-shaped glass. It emphasizes the
color, clarity and effervescence of the Pilsner. It's similar in
principle to the fluted champagne glass, but having larger rim,
affords larger sips.
The traditional mug is a robust glass, primarly aimed at ""chinking""
glasses together and allowing large swallows of beer. 
The challace/goblet can be beautiful pieces of work, designed to
showcase the beer, and also promote and maintain a large head. 
The tulip glass captures volatiles (in the narrow part of the glass)
while the large opening at the top supports a large head.
The Sniffer, typically used for cognac/brandy, but also for very
strong ales, has a large base that curves up to a small opening to
capture the aromatics, and to allow for swirling to encourage more
aromatics to be released.
The Stange, a long tall glass, amplifies the malt and hop
characteristics by concentrating them in a smaller area, while also
providing a simple elegant presentation of the beer. Often used with
delicate beers.
The Weizen glass is similar to the pilsner glass, but larger
(typically 0.5l minimum) with plenty of room for the large head
typical of a wheat beer.

  Are any ingredients for brewing either unavailable or prohibitively expensive depending on season?


I doubt this is the case—if an ingredient were impractical to obtain in other seasons but one, then I'd imagine the price of that seasonal beer would be extraordinary, which isn't the case with Sam Adams' seasonal beers.

If by chance there do exist such ingredients, then the next question is—are any of those ingredients used in Sam Adams' seasonal beers, which itself is a difficult question, since Sam Adams' recipes are proprietary. From Sam Adams' site, though,


  Samuel Adams® Octoberfest is a malt lover's dream, masterfully blending together five roasts of barley to create a delicious harmony of sweet flavors including caramel and toffee. The beer is kept from being overly sweet by the elegant bitterness imparted by the German Noble hops.


Unless one of those ""five roasts of barley"" (providing the above is even true and not a marketing statement itself) is some rarity in other seasons, which I highly doubt, again, I'd say mass produced seasonal beers are only ""seasonal"" for the sake of marketing and inducing a certain feel—

With that said, most of the recipes I'm seeing make it clear that you want to use a light beer, so obviously you're not gonna want to use a stout or porter here (though I'd be curious how it tastes; my friend swears by Guinness in his beef stew). With that said, most lagers or pilsners (a type of lager) should be fine for your purposes (of course I would avoid macro-lagers like Bud, Coors, and Miller because they are awful). Anchor Steam Beer might be interesting in the soup as it packs a lot of flavor for a lager type beer in my opinion. For authenticity, you're likely gonna want to use a pilsner. You have to realize, as the Wikipedia article points out, that until the 1840's or so, most beer from the area was top-fermented (like ales; modern pilsners and lagers are bottom-fermented) and the taste varied widely, so I'm not sure how a beer 300-500 years ago would have tasted. The closest you'll likely be able to go back is the 1840's; in which case I'd give Pilsner Urquell a shot as it's the first pilsner beer in the world. Victory makes a mean pilsner (Braumeister Pils) too. Unfortunately it's draft only, so if you have a growler handy you can use it; otherwise best look elsewhere. Of course you can probably get away with most Czech pilsners. I can't figure out why Beer Advocate doesn't have a sorting option so that you can sort based upon the rating, but I digress. 

You have to remember that beer was much different 300-500 years ago. Yes, there are some breweries such as  Dogfish Head who recreate ancient ales. Yards has also recreated three brews based upon George Washington's, Thomas Jefferson's, and Ben Franklin's (my favorite of the three) original recipes. But for the most part, beer has evolved in the last 300-500 years; even in the case of the Dogfish Head and Yards brews I mentioned since they have to be pasteurized and must meet the (stupid) FDA standards here in the US. If you've ever tried raw milk, you know how much pasteurization changes the flavor; same goes for juice and beer.

With that said, lets go back to the whole top-fermenting thing. You might want to give a grätzer a try as well. It's an ancient Polish beer which has been recently making a comeback. There's a project going on right now to recreate the brew. However, since the brew is so (recently) new, I'm not sure how available it is; you'll likely have to make a trip to San Francisco to get some. There are others too, such as those offered by Westbrook Brewing Co. and Schlossbrauerei Au. But I'm not sure how readily available these are either. You're probably better off brewing this once yourself until this beer is pulled off the ""endangered beers"" list. Yards has also experimented with this style, but again, it's not readily available (see Tadeusz Kosciuszko Smoked Pol)

321,2,,2014-01-25T05:31:54.827,5,,"A few notes on brewing and the seasons.  It isn't a question of availability today but there are other factors that likely have seasonal impact.

Traditionally (say, 1000 years ago), yes, brewing recipes would vary with the seasons.  Some ingredients like henbane seed or barley keep extremely well.  Others do better  fresh (herbs and such).  It is likely that gruit components varied with the seasons.  This is not an issue today.  Aside from some components of other beers (pumpkin ale, beers with seasonal fruit), most beers today do not involve ingredients that are problematic to preserve over a year.

There is a second issue though.  That is that beers traditionally have another factor which is starch content.  The starch contributes significantly to calorie count of the beer, and usually darker, richer beers have higher carbohydrate count.  It makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather, and it makes sense that darker, heavier beers would be favored in winter while lighter beers would be favored in summer (although as one would note the heavier beers came out of traditions of using them as bread substitutes for fasting monks and so would have year-round applicability in monasteries).

I don't think it has to do with availability.  I think instead it has to do with seasonal expectations and reserving richer, heavier, higher starch beers for the winter (we have higher metabolism in winter, see http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf, and generally less availability of fresh foods before modern refrigeration and rapid transport).  I don't know when this became common though.  In general, when I look back a thousand years ago, I don't see anything in primary sources to suggest heavier malts in the winter.  So trying to date this would seem speculative.  There is a fairly obvious practical pattern though.

EDIT:  As I think about this, I would note that aside from lagers, it is very hard to brew in the winter in a colder climate.  There may also be a component where heavier, stronger beers keep better and therefore keep into the winter better.

322,2,,2014-01-25T05:55:26.993,14,,"The answer is complex, to be honest.  In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.

The answer I think to the question as stated has to be ""no"" insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).

Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England

This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).

If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while ""ealu"" (-> ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, ""beor"" (-> beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen (""Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink"") suggests that ""beor"" must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.

Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.

Example 2:  Medieval Iceland

The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (godhi, bondi, and thrall) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a godhi (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a godhord (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A bondi (free juryman) owned land.  And a thrall was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.

In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill's Saga, Njall's Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from ""continental"" Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki's Saga.

In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It's probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There's a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.

323,2,,2014-01-25T08:00:05.547,5,,"In a nutshell, most beer judging is based on how well the beer represents the style category that it is entered into. 

These aspects of the beer are evaluated to see if they match with what is expected for the style:


appearance: color / foam / clarity
aroma: malt / hop / yeast / esters
mouthfeel: body / carbonation
flavor: lots here - see below
aftertaste: flavors and aromas that persist after the beer is swallowed
overall impression: drinkability 


All of these are evaluated with respect to what is expected for the style, and points assigned. The beer may be perfectly drinkable, but be marked down because it doesn't fit with the style. For example, a hefeweizen that is dark would be lose points for appearance since they are light-colored beers by style.

Judging sheets often have a list of flavor descriptors. Some flavors are bad for any beer, such as rubber, astringent, soapy, while others may or may not be considered faults depending upon style. For example, fruitiness in an English Ale is much desired, but not in a Pilsner, similarly low levels of diacetyl in a Stout is acceptable, but not in a Hefeweizen.

I didn't know much about beers until I moved to San Diego, where I was introduced to beer flights:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Somehow, I'd never heard of or seen them!

A flight is 4 or 5 small servings of beer, typically in 4.5- to 5-oz. glasses, usually served on a ""paddle."" At least in San Diego, a flight costs as much as a pint on draught, so often it's a no-brainer to get flights if you want to taste a variety of beers. When you order a flight, you of course get to choose what 4 or 5 beers you'd like to have. I often select similar beers—a set of stouts and porters—or a bunch of IPAs (and doubles)—so I can really get a chance to taste what distinguishes specific brands and subtypes.

When a friend of mine flew in from New York (also never having heard of flights), he was enthusiastic about getting two flights and sharing all 10—doing blind tests on one another. He went from saying, before we got to the bar, ""All beer tastes the same to me—I can only taste dark or light,"" to, ""Oh man, I didn't know I was even capable of tasting such little differences!""

So, beer flights are an effective yet casual and fun way to get yourself or anyone to appreciate the multifarious tastes of beers.

I think trying to start with all the ingredients, brewing processes, and the (dizzying) gamut of terminologies for all the subtle tastes, might be like teaching someone to drive by starting with the difference between torque and horsepower—they can't fully appreciate the meaning of words until they've experienced the sensations they describe. By contrasting beers side-by-side, we build an internal, as-of-yet-wordless ""vocabulary"" of tastes, e.g ""This beer has more of... that thing, whatever it's called, than this one,"" and then we learn terminology (and ingredients and processes) as a means of filling those voids in words for senses we've experienced. Otherwise, we're storing abstract definitions, which we don't retain very well.

My limited experience with bits of Europe indicates beer there is sold by the mL. Also worth noting is that Liter can be represented as either L or l so when you see ""l"" you're seeing Liters.

So, no. There isn't a global unit of volume for beer. But it is almost always sold by volume.

Also, with the rising popularity of high gravity beers, standard beer servings vary in part because to serve similar amounts of alcohol across standard servings you've got to serve differing quantities.

334,2,,2014-01-26T03:27:35.467,7,,"Sour malt (aka. acidulated malt, saurmalt) is a base malt that has been processed so that it contains lactic acid.

The acid is useful in adjusting the pH of the mash during brewing. Typically brewers use a 1-10% with 2-5% being typical. 

The malt's existence is due to the Reinheitsgebot - the German Beer Purity law. This forbids the use of any ingredients other than malt, hops, water and yeast - making the use of other additives to adjust mash pH illegal. Hence, saurmalt was developed as a way to allow brewers to adjust the mash pH while staying within the restrictions of the purity law.

Nowadays, using a sour mash goes way further than just correcting pH. It's used to define the sourness in some beers, such as Berliner Weisse, Lambics, Flemish Reds and Browns and Stouts. 

So, while you can't buy a beer made only with sour malt, there are plenty that have used it, or an equivalent souring technique to produce the sour notes in the beer.

Appearance: How much head?  How long did the head last?  What color was it?  What color is the beer itself?
Aroma: What do you smell?  How strong is the smell?
Taste: What do you taste?  How does that compare what you smelled?  How's the aftertaste?
Mouthfeel: Usually just watery, oily, or creamy.


Tasting notes like this force you to really concentrate on the taste, which helps improve your palate.  They're also nice because you now have a record of your thoughts on that beer to refer to later (maybe to compare to other beers of that style).

Having different glasses for different types of beers can affect your drinking experience in a number of different ways. First off, having an unusual or unique glass can often be very fun, because it's probably not something you're used to. The first time I ever drank beer from a litre mug was a very fun experience for me, and not because it made the beer taste differently. Secondly, I find that different types of glasses encourage me to enjoy the beer in different ways. I find that glasses with stems, which are often used for stronger beers, encourage me to drink the beer more slowly and savor it a bit more than a glass without a stem. I think these effects on experience are one of the big reasons for the wide variations in beer glassware. As a beer manufacturer, if I could make a unique glass that will better help people remember my beer, I would consider that a worthwhile investment.

Always rinse your glasses immediately: your job's much harder if the lacing and sediment dries caked on the glass.
Hand wash your glassware, not only because of the detergent, but also because the best glasses are made of the thinnest glass, so they're quite delicate.
Use a beer-specific cleaning agent, a percarbonate cleaner like PBW, One-Step or B-Brite.  These are formulated specifically to deal with the compounds that beer leaves in a glass.


If you only ever drink beer out of your beer glasses and always rinse them soon after, you'll find that you can wash with a pretty weak cleaning solution.  I almost never need more than about 1/2 ounce of PBW in a gallon of hot water.

The beer has already been fermented when added to a conditioning tank, where it is left to mature for several days (the 7th step), from here it is cooked to remove the alcohol. Due to the absurdly high boiling point of water (100°C), it is easy to evaporate the alcohol (boiling point = 78.3°C) and leave the rest of the beer behind.  Vacuum evaporation is also used in most modern breweries to preserve flavor and speed up the process.

Another method used is reverse osmosis, which allows the water and alcohol to escape from the beer through a membrane. The alcohol is then distilled from the solution, and the water is added back to the sugary syrup originally left behind, reforming the beer (minus alcohol).

The beer is now non-alcoholic and continues to the last step of the brewing process where it is filtered, carbonated, and stored (until it is packaged for sale).

The tang you feel is dissolved metal and a component of that, depending on the pewter, may be lead (or could be copper, tin, bismuth, antimony, etc).  A major factor in that is acidity, and both hops and carbonation contribute.

Acidic solutions react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and dissolved metal salts.  So carbonic acid from carbonated beer will react with the tin to produce hydrogen and tin carbonate, and the same basic process with other metals.  The specific metal that reacts will depend on the pewter.

There are some ways around this.  You could, for example, coat the inside of the vessel with bees wax.  This can then be washed by hand with hot tap water and soap (and is a common method in making drinking horns).  This has the pro/con (depending on your taste) of imparting a slight honey taste to everything you drink out of the vessel.

If the beer served on nitro has more than 35% CO2 then it's a good idea to reduce how hard you pour - as the percentage of CO2 increases, so does the size of the foam with a hard pour.

I would say that the choice of beer in this case should depend on one of this factors:


You want to accompany or match the taste of the steak and seasoning.
You want to have the beer as a regular drink nearby that does not disturb the taste of the 
steak.


I will assume that you only use salt and pepper for seasoning.  

Case 1:  

For this, I would recommend a Dunkel (dark lager). From my experience, it compliments the taste of the steak and seasoning, without disturbing it.
The taste does not sit in your mouth too long, thus if you wait a moment (few seconds) between beer and the mashed potatoes, it should not cause any trouble with them, too.

Case 2:

If the beer is just meant as a drink nearby that should not disturb the taste of the meat, any lighter Pils (pale lager) should be fine.
It does not have a long lasting taste, goes well with mashed potato and does not clash with the steak.

I am from Germany, thus my choices might be a bit... regional. All of the above are just personal recommendations, based on my experience.

Stouts tends to be more bitter, so tougher to drink for those not used to it
Serving on N2 (""Nitro"") creates the illusion of a thicker mouthfeel (it's not fully understood at present quite why that is)
The lower CO2 levels removes a certain ""light"" quality from the beer. Beers with more CO2 feel lighter, effervescent and easier to drink.

Since the keg is kept at room temperature, if the beer is unpasteurized the flavor will evolve at a faster rate than refrigerated beer would.  This isn't a change due to the quick cooling, per se, but it is a possibly major difference.
As mentioned by @acheong, the CO2 solubility of beer is significantly lower at room temperature, so keeping the beer properly carbonated becomes a more difficult task.  Specifically, you have to keep the pressure much higher, making the serving pressure higher, which makes the complex calculus of draft line measurements that much harder.
Chill haze could be an issue.  If the brewer didn't take steps to prevent it, there'll be haze-inducing proteins in suspension.  If the beer is stored cool, these will quickly fall out, but if it's kept warm and only cooled at the time it's served, they'll end up in your glass.

Sure there is always a risk that a different culture of fungi or bacteria takes over, killing off the yeast (and e.g. producing vinegar instead of alcohol) but if brewing is performed in relative cleanliness, with little contaminants that could disrupt the process, the natural yeast will take over and dominate it, killing off all competing cultures.

Currently, cultured yeast provide a kick-start to the process, simply leaving no time for different cultures to dominate the batch, and radically shortening the process that would normally take a long time until natural yeast reaches concentrations you create by just adding cultured yeast, but it's not essential to the process - it's just a strong push in the right direction.

Other factors such as any adjuncts used in the beer can affect this as well.

For example, a low gravity, low alcohol ale using an efficient yeast strain can be ready to drink in as little as 10 days.  However a heavy lager beer can take 2-3 months to complete and some Belgian yeast strains can take several weeks to complete fermentation.

Some beers go through additional conditioning post-fermentation before they are at their prime to drink.  This conditioning may include simple bottle conditioning or barrel-aging to impart different flavors.  There are some barrel-ages stout beers that have taken 18+ months to complete the process before the brewer feels they are ready to serve.

Though yeast was only identified as a microorganism recently, it has been known as the cause of fermentation for many centuries.  It's easy to underestimate how sophisticated people throughout history were.

Before yeast was monocultured in labs it was actively cultured by brewers.  They would transfer the yeast cake from a batch that's finishing into a recently-brewed batch.  This cake contained a whole ecosystem of yeasts and bacterias, but a few strains were usually dominant.

By applying artificial selection brewers developed different strains of yeast in different areas.  The yeast culture was the make-or-break characteristic of a brewery, and defined the styles of beer that could be produced more than any other factor (other than water in Burton).

Evidence of this process comes from the history of lager: bottom-fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces carlsbergensis) emerged in the fifteenth century as a direct result of the cold storage regime of northern brewers such as Carlsberg.

They may not have known it was a microorganism, but middle ages brewers most certainly knew that yeast was the cause of fermentation.  That's why they called it ""Godisgood"".

Formaldehyde was detected in beer, at safe levels, as far back as 1983:


  A simple procedure was developed for the determination of formaldehyde in samples of beer and soft drinks. [...] Levels of formaldehyde found were in the low mg/kg range. Detection limits were less than 0.1 mg/kg of sample.


Lawrence, J. F. and Iyengar, J. R. The Determination of Formaldehyde in Beer and Soft Drinks by HPLC of the 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazone Derivative. 1983; published online 2006. [URL]

A more recent study summarizes how China came under scrutiny, but also how industry standards have changed since (emphasis mine, hereon):


  In 2005, various Chinese newspapers reported that formaldehyde was detected in 95% of the samples of Chinese commercial bottled beers tested in the course of a journalistic investigation. The addition of formaldehyde during mashing is allowed in China, and it is believed to improve the clarity of the resulting wort and beer and the colloidal stability of the latter. Nevertheless, the hygienic standard for fermented alcoholic beverages in China was revised, to stipulate that the formaldehyde content of the finished beer must not exceed 2 mg/L.


Wu, Q. et al. Investigation into Benzene, Trihalomethanes, and Formaldehyde in Chinese Lager Beers. 2012. [PDF]

From the abstract of the same paper,


  Beers brewed commercially in China have been surveyed for the presence of a number of potential contaminants, including benzene, trihalomethanes and formaldehyde. [...] Formaldehyde was measured in 29 beers (including 7 imported brands) using solid-phase microextraction with on-fiber derivatization. Formaldehyde levels were between 0.082&ndash;0.356 mg/L. None of the beer samples exceeded WHO drinking water criteria for benzene, trihalomethanes or formaldehyde.


The researchers compared their results to existing literature, which they found were similar:


  Donhauser and co-workers examined beers from Europe, using a HPLC method, and showed that 65% of them contained detectable formaldehyde, although in many the level was close to the detection limit of 0.2 mg/L. More recently, the South Korean Food and Drug Administration has analysed imported beers (13 from China and 4 from Germany). They found that the average content of formaldehyde was 0.132 mg/L, which was compatible with food safety legislation.


(I couldn't find a free link to the above-referenced material, only a citation.)

Apparently, formaldehyde does appear naturally in the brewing process (though, again, I couldn't find the study, only another citation):


  Borchert has confirmed that formaldehyde can be formed naturally in the brewing process, thus beers can contain up to 0.1 mg/L of formaldehyde, even when none is used in the brewery.


Anyway, formaldehyde no longer seems preferred as a clarification agent, as a substitute exists:


  To meet consumer expectations and to avoid further problems, more and more breweries now choose PVPP as a replacement product for the clarification of wort and beer.

Warning: This method is error-prone, high-effort, and probably not worth your time.  Could be fun, though.  :)

Most commercial beer is force-carbonated.  That is to say, the beer is produced and ready to drink (minus the fizz) before they put it in the bottle and mechanically carbonate the beer.

Beer that is bottle-conditioned or bottle-fermented, however, is put into a bottle with some extra sugar.  The beer is intentionally left with a little of the yeast from the fermentation process, and is sealed with the sugar.  The yeast then does it's normal thing: it eats the sugar and excretes alcohol plus carbon-dioxide.  Since the bottle is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, so it goes into dissolution in the beer, giving you that fizz.  Most bottled homebrew will be like this.

So, if you have a beer that is both flat and was bottle-conditioned (and therefore still has some yeast in it), you might be able to bottle-ferment it again:


Add a very small amount of sugar to the bottle.  Table sugar works, although corn sugar (which you can find from a brew store) is ideal.  It'll be really hard to get the right amount (about 0.083 oz), so I recommend pre-measured tablets of the stuff: http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/munton-s-carb-tabs.html
Seal the bottle somehow.  If you have a bottle-capper and some caps, that'd be ideal.  Otherwise, you might be able to get by with a soda bottle and cap.  If you're really lucky, your beer is in a swing top bottle.
Wait a week, maybe a couple to be sure.


If you're lucky, there's enough viable yeast in the bottle to start acting again (now that it has new sugar to eat), which will create more CO2 and recarbonate the bottle.

  Strong, spicy food (classic with curry!); bold, sweet desserts like carrot cake


and for a Double/Imperial IPA is


  Smoked beef brisket, grilled lamb; Southern chicken-fried steak.


I found a great little summary by Michael Agnew (2012) that explains some of the rationale behind these pairings (emphasis mine hereon):


  When pairing IPA with food you have three basic flavor hooks at your disposal; bitterness, hop flavor (spicy, grassy, herbal, earthy, and citrus), and caramel. Hop flavors have a great affinity for spices and light fruits. Bitterness has a cooling affect. Paired with spicy dishes, IPA will fan the flames at first, but douse them in the end. Bitterness also amplifies salty and umami flavors. The caramel flavors in the beer will latch onto the sweeter side of a dish, tying into things like caramelized onion or the crispy skins of roast poultry. And the hop acids and carbonation make IPAs great palate cleansers to take on even the fattiest deep-fried delights.


Samuel Adams has a ""Pair with Sam"" tool, and looking at its suggested pairings for their Whitewater IPA (hoppier than their Latitude 48 IPA), pork appears to be the meat of choice: pulled pork, barbeque ribs, chorizo, roasted pork tenderloin, and sweet sausage; and the rest of its suggestions align with the salty-and-spicy pattern we've  seen.

We seem to have found strong consensus already, but just one more to make sure. In Blue Point Brewing Company's words, its IPA pairings are meant to complement


  intensely flavorful, highly spiced dishes, such as curry, and bold, sweet desserts like flourless chocolate cake and crème brulée


or


  rich, aromatic, spicy and smoked foods such as chili, BBQ ribs, grilled chicken, and beef.

This chart shows the year-over-year increase in sales by style.  You'll note here that, at least in 2011, porters weren't growing very fast either.

More recent data was a little hard to come by, but it seems that the overall sales numbers are unlikely to change that much in a couple years: IPAs, Pale ales, Ambers and Amber Lagers are probably still topping the charts.  So it's not that porters don't sell at all, but they're certainly not top earners.

Drifting into conjecture, I would say that the people interested in 'big beers' will take a stout over a porter, and those interested in a more subtle beer will go for a brown or an amber, leaving porters in a bit of a no-man's-land in the middle.

Tapping the top causes compression waves started through the air in the opening (which is why it only works from the top.) The compression waves bounce at the bottom and become expansion waves. The compression and expansion causes agitation which foams up the beer. 

Tell me more...

The layman's summary from Scientists discover why beer bottles overflow after a sudden impact:


  A lot happens in the short period of time between tap and torrent. The
  moment some jerk clocks your bottle's mouth, a compression wave
  travels down through the glass. When the wave hits bottom, it's
  reflected as an expansion wave that travels through the beer. These
  waves keep bouncing back and forth, with the compression waves
  breaking up the CO2 bubbles in your beer into thousands of incredibly
  tiny microbubbles, and the expansion waves causing those microbubbles
  to violently expand into skyrocketing plumes.
  
  The result? Millions and millions of expanding CO2 bubbles turn your
  beer into foam shooting out of your bottle. With any luck, it spills
  all over your jerk friend's pants.


The abstract from the published article:


  A sudden vertical impact on the mouth of a beer bottle generates a
  compression wave that propagates through the glass towards the bottom.
  When this wave reaches the base of the bottle, it is transmitted to
  the liquid as an expansion wave that travels to free surface, where it
  bounces back as a compression wave. This train of
  expansion-compression waves drives the forced cavitation of existing
  air pockets, leading to their violent collapse. A cloud of very small
  daughter bubbles are generated upon these collapses, that expand much
  faster than their mothers due to their smaller size. These rapidly
  growing bubble clusters effectively act as buoyancy sources, what
  leads to the formation of bubble-laden plumes whose void fraction
  increases quickly by several orders of magnitude, eventually turning
  most of the liquid into foam.

The ""Pale"" in Pale Ale is mostly historical. In the 18th century, most beers were dark due to being produced with barley malt that was kilned or roasted over wood fires. But from England emerged a new technique using pale malts, cured in coke-fuelled kilns. This applied to both ales and lagers, resulting in beers that were bronze, copper or gold—and while you wouldn't look at such colors today and consider them notably ""pale,"" they certainly were pale in contrast to beers back then. In the turn of the 19th century and beyond, the style spread from England to the rest of Europe—


  When a new brewery was built in Pilsen in Bohemia in 1842, a coke-fired kiln was imported from England. The result was the first golden lager, Pilsner Urquell, which was made possible by British ingenuity and technical advance.

469,2,,2014-01-31T18:04:04.900,7,,"There are two ways a brewery can measure the abv:


By wort gravity: by measuring the specific gravity of the wort (the sugar solution that the yeast ferment into beer) both before and after fermentation. The difference is the amount of sugar consumed, which can be used to approximate the amount of alcohol produced. 
By distillation: the sample is heated, so the water and ethanol (alcohol) evaporate off and are collected in a condenser. The specific gravity of this is measured, which can then be used to calculate the percentage of alcohol, since the densities of alcohol and water are both known. 


Both methods are exact and the accuracy is entirely due to the accuracy of the equipment used to measure. 

The least accurate and precise is the case of (say) a microbrewer using a regular glass hydrometer to measure the OG and FG (method 1 above) - these read to 4 significant digits, with an accuracy of +/-1 SG at best. Without getting into the details, the accuracy then is about +/-5% of the final value for a regular strength beer. So for a 5% beer, that would be +/-0.25%.

With lab grade equipment, the accuracy of method 2 can be as good as 0.05%, since the specific gravities are measured with greater precision (and accuracy.) So our 5% beer would be with accuracy 0.0025%.

Higher quality brewers’ solution was to sell their beer in green bottles so a consumer could tell the difference between a regular beer and a higher quality. The green beer bottle became a status symbol for many European breweries.
  
  These days, there’s not much of a reason to sell a beer in a green bottle other than for marketing and aesthetic. Many companies use it to distinguish their beer from others. Of course, some beers have used green bottles for so long, it would seem silly to switch to a brown glass now.

Winemakers were allowed to continue producing various grape products like grape juice, and even sold home wine kits with explicit instructions on how to avoid making wine from them.  Very tongue-in-cheek.  A lot of liquor distillers managed to survive somewhat on their liquors being considered ""medicinal"".  Beer, however, basically got demolished.  Especially considering their suffering during World War 1, which had just ended when prohibition began.  Any businesses that survived prohibition that used to be breweries either became producers of other products like ice cream or made barely alcoholic barley-based beverages.  Brewing in the US was at a huge disadvantage coming out of prohibition, and the few surviving large companies managed to successfully lobby to have the new distribution laws written to benefit them.

Also, as I mentioned wine and liquor sort of continued to be produced during Prohibition.  This led to their presence in the speakeasies, and their inclusion in the invention of many new cocktails.  People being used to them over the past few years, and the allure of being what was drank in speakeasies, acted as built in marketing.  Which beer lacked.

Finally, beer was much less transportable than wine or liquor, especially liquor.  While localized wineries managed to survive, most people's local brewery had folded.  Liquor and wine became go-to drinks, and the only beer being promoted was from a few larger companies that needed to ramp up to reach everyone.  They were basically able to write their own ticket.

We're sort of in the opposite place now where consumer demand is for beer instead of liquor and wine, and the demand is for beer that's coming from smaller and more regional breweries, which I imagine is how wine was back in the day.

Why are airplane pilots regulated differently from car drivers?  Because it's much easier to do damage with one vs the other.  Likewise, it's a lot easier to get so drunk that you do something stupid (or just get alcohol poisoning) on liquor than beer.  As such, they're treated differently.

Part of it is political

The companies that make beer are not generally the same ones that make liquor.  Those two groups of companies also have different groups of lobbyists, who have pushed for laws at different times in different political climates.

Part of it is practical

Liquor and beer production face different logistical needs.  For example:


Beer has much higher shipping costs per dollar worth of product, so shipping rules might need to be different.
Breweries have a need to keep their product cold at the point of sale, so it might make sense to have them sold in stores that already have coolers (like gas stations), whereas liquor companies wouldn't push as hard for that availability.
Liquor has no equivalent of the brewpub, so they don't really care much about sales at their production facility.
Beer has less consumer utility per unit of volume than liquor (ie, you need more of it to have the same amount of fun), so people generally need it closer to their houses.  Since you don't need to buy liquor as often as you buy beer, it's more feasible to have centralized liquor stores


Part of it is ""moral""

Especially on the US East coast, there are a lot of laws around booze with their origins in religious morality and the puritan aversion to alcohol.  Beer, being seen as a ""lesser evil"", tends to have less opposition to laws that would increase its availability.

IMO, the suggested duplicate answers a different question, only answering the hydration question too, by side-effect. Personally, I like this question paired with that answer, better than that question.

tl;dr — Alcohol is a diuretic (defined: a substance that promotes the production of urine), causing you to expel more water than the body would normally expel.

That much has been shown conclusively.


  If sufficient alcohol is ingested, the diuresis occurs at the expense of all cellular components, and dehydration ensues.


Roberts, K. E. Mechanism of Dehydration Following Alcohol Ingestion. 1963. [Abstract (HTML)]

As far back as the 1930s, researchers were trying to understand whether alcohol—the substance itself—is a diuretic, or indirectly induces chemicals which are diuretic (or which inhibit antidiuretics) or triggers cortical functions that cause diuresis.


  [Most] writers either state categorically or imply that alcohol per se has no diuretic action. In 1932, however, from a comparison of the diuretic effects of a given volume of water, with and without alcohol, [...] Murray concluded that alcohol itself was exerting a diuretic action. [...] The diuretic action of alcohol has now been demonstrated on five other subjects, and its mode of action investigated [...]


Eggleton, M. G. The Diuretic Action of Alcohol in Man. 1941. [Full Paper (PDF)]

The first paper (1963) actually confirmed that alcohol—yes, ethanol itself—inhibits antidiuretic hormones, causing diuresis, causing dehydration. (Caffeine does this too, by the way.)

So, yeah. That's how that happens.



Unrelated, but I found this interesting in the second paper...


  It [the diuresis] is initiated by the increase in blood-alcohol concentration and fails to be maintained if this concentration is kept steady, even at high levels [...] The diuretic response to alcohol differs markedly in one respect from that of the cerebral cortex. The latter is most affected by the rate of increase in blood-alcohol concentration: the greater this rate of increase, the greater the disturbance of function at any absolute concentration. The diuretic response, on the other hand, is dependent mainly on the duration of increasing blood-alcohol concentration and not on the rate of increase (Tables 6, 7). The naturally slow absorber, therefore, tends to give a larger diuretic response than the rapid absorber.


The slower you get drunk, the more dehydrated you'll be!

Types of malt used: light malt typically produces larger, more dish-soapy bubbles. Roasted or dark malts will typically produce smaller bubbles.

These are usually forms of protein. One of the best silky mouth feel beers I've ever had is Flying Dog Pearl Necklace Oyster Stout. Yes - they actually add oysters to the brew. The protein makes for an amazing feel.
Amount of carbonation: pretty self explanatory. Mo' gas, mo' bubbles. Higher ABV beers and very malty beers can sometimes hold almost no CO2. Give these a rough pour to produce a decent head.
Type of carbonation: CO2 produces larger bubbles while nitrogen produces very fine small bubbles which gives Guinness its famous silky creamy head.
Conditioning &amp; storage: bottle conditioned beer will hold more CO2 and have a different head and mouth feel and coarser bubbles. kegs carbonated by pressurizing with CO2 will hold less and be a bit foamier.


With regards to the pour, if less head is desired, tilt the glass at least 45 degrees and pour slowly, on the glass, rising as you pour to always be pouring just above the level of the beer. For more head, well... dump 'er in.

502,2,,2014-02-02T09:48:18.087,13,,"In short, the main factors in aging is a combination of compounds breaking down and oxidation.

IPAs - hop aroma breakdown

For IPAs, it's the hop aromas that break down fairly quickly - the aromatic compounds are volatile and break down noticably within a short timeframe:


  Tom Nielsen, Sierra Nevada’s senior research analyst focused on hop
  degradation, says that their research has shown that after about two
  and a half to three months, hop aroma in a packaged beer, derived
  mainly from beta acids in the hop flower, has already started to
  diminish significantly. It’s a sentiment backed by Patrick Langlois at
  Great Divide in Denver, brewers of notable hoppy beers including their
  Fresh Hop Pale Ale, Titan IPA, and Hercules Double IPA. “Hops tend to
  dissipate in three to four months, which is why that is the
  recommended shelf life for most of our beers. 
  (Source)


Barley Wines - Oxidation

Barley wines are not hop flavor or aroma focused beers - the major hop component is bittering acids, so they don't suffer the same problem with aroma losses as IPAs. However, some of the bittering compounds also have a half-life of 1 year, so clear changes are happening in that timeframe to the bitterness.

However, the major change for a barleywine is oxidation. There is always oxygen in the beer - either small amounts introduced during packaging, or from oxidization during the mash, which is then later released into the beer. When alcohol in the beer oxidizes, it becomes ethanal (acetaldehyde) which is a main component in sherry, and gives apple or sherry-like tones, which in a big barleywine are considered positive effects of aging, if kept in check. 

Stouts

Contrasting with both IPAs and barleywines, Stouts that are meant for aging are neither hop focused nor benefit much from oxidation. Oxidizing the medium roasted malts in the wort would produce cardboard flavors due to production of trans-2-nonenal. Fortunately, the highly kilned malts act as an anti-oxidant to help prevent the beer from oxidizing. What little odization does occur tends to produce port-like flavors.

The roasty character in stout comes from large Maillard compounds. These are still poorly understood, I can't find research to back it up, but I would guess the roasty character mellows due to the large compounds breaking down into shorter ones. This might explain why in some stouts the dark fruit flavors become more emphasized over time (since they are shorter Maillard compounds.)

505,2,,2014-02-03T08:57:40.450,1,,"It's complicated.  I think you have to look at these laws as an intersection of the practical and the cultural.

Let's look at two different distinctions you make.

Home Production

In the US, you can usually make your own beer, mead, or wine, but cannot make hard liquor without a license from BATF, state licenses, tax payments, etc.  Exact laws of course vary state by state, but the US tax code contains exemptions for home brewers and wine makers.

Part of the reason here is historical.  Liquor is a major tax source, and black market liquor hasn't always been very safe.  We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.

A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.

Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings

Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.

Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don't believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.

Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.

In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component.

509,2,,2014-02-03T18:57:24.987,7,,"I'll answer one half and leave the other half to someone else.

OG is “Original Gravity”

Specific Gravity (often shorted to just ‘gravity’) is a measure of the density of a liquid.  Since its is mostly water, you can compare beer’s density to water to find out how much other stuff is in it.  Water has a gravity of 1.000, and beers will often have an original gravity of 1.200 to 1.020.

“Original Gravity” is the density of beer before it’s fermented (when it’s called ‘wort’), and “Final Gravity” is the density after it’s fermented.  You can determine the alcohol content of a beer by comparing the two gravities and inferring how much fermentable “stuff” disappeared during fermentation (i.e., was converted to alcohol and CO2).

In commercial beer, you can use OG as a shorthand for how “Big” the beer is because it indicates how much malt and other fermentable stuff was in it.  So a lighter-flavored beer like a blonde or a pilnser will often have a low original gravity (1.020 to 1.050, for example), whereas a big stout or barelywine might have a higher original gravity (1.080 up to as much as 1.200).

OG is in important measurement for home brewers, so another use of it on a commercial beer is to help people produce clones of said beer at home by reproducing the OG (among other factors).

Definition

To get a little more technical, Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one liquid to another.  In brewing, we always use water.  So, the density of water divided by the density of water is 1.000.  The density of beer divided by the density of water is what we refer to as ‘gravity’ when discussing beer.  And since it’s a ratio of two identical measures, there are no units.  It’s not 1.000 somethings; it’s just 1.000.

Plato

Homebrewers often use ""brewer's points"" (eg 1.123), but you'll sometimes see the ""Plato Scale"", which is more popular in central Europe.  A good approximation is that 1˚ plato = 4 brewer's points.  So 12˚ Plato corresponds to a gravity of 1.048.

510,2,,2014-02-03T18:57:55.277,16,,"From the figures you posted,

OG - ""Original Gravity"". When measured with a hydrometer, it measures the density relative to water. E.g. 1.010 is 1% heavier than water. The units here are degrees Plato (&deg;P), which describe the amount of dissolved sugars. Here, 15 means 15% dissolved sugar. This means the beer (or more correctly, the wort) contained 15% sugar before fermentation started.

RDF - The real degree of fermentation. This is in contrast to the Apparent Degree of Fermentation, which is (OG-FG)/OG. When the final gravity is measured using hydrometer, the alcohol in the beer, being less dense than water (SG. 0.789) causes the gravity to appear lower, so it looks as though the yeast has fermented more sugar than it actually has. The Real degree of Fermentation takes the alcohol into account and computes the actual amount of sugars fermented. This tells you the how much of the original sugar was fermented (as a percentage). 

So, what does this mean in practice?


  Winter Bock - 15 OG, 62.5 RDF - light, tasty, ever so slightly bitter


This has an average RDF for a beer that size, so it will be somewhat malty, but not cloying.


  Hazelnut Dark - 15 OG, 60.4 RDF - nice bitter red with slightly sweet aftertaste


This has more dissolved sugars in it compared to the Bock, so you'd expect it to be a thicker mouthfeel and slightly more sweet, although you may not taste the sweetness if it's offset by roasted malts.


  Chocolate Stout - 14.8 OG, 66.8 RDF - very sweet with hints of chocolate and malt


Being the driest of all the beers, yet the taste description is given as very sweet. This shows that knowing the residual sugars doesn't tell you the sweetness, simply because there are different kinds of residual sugar. For example, dextrins create body, but have relatively little taste, so would taste not as sweet as a beer containing a lot of residual maltose or glucose.

514,2,,2014-02-04T05:18:20.820,14,,"A rye beer is any beer that incorporates rye, usually malted rye. 

How much Rye and how it tastes

There are no laws to state that the quantity of rye should be above some minimum, so some rye beers include just a few percent of the malt bill as rye, while others such as Roggenbier base their entire flavor profile on rye, using over 50% rye malt. With such a large difference in the grain bill and the amount of rye, the two beers taste very different.

When rye is added to beer between 10-20% of the grain bill, it gives a pleasant spiciness and bread-like quality to the beer that blends well with most hop types, particularly spicy or citrussy hops. Rye can also add some dryness to the aftertaste.

Above 20% the spiciness becomes progressively more assertive and the beer fuller, more earthy and hearty, and perhaps not unsurprisingly, tastes similar to rye bread.

Var-rye-ation

Rye beers show considerable variation. Rye is a versatile ingredient, which has become increasingly popular recently with craft brewers, so there is no longer a common theme underlying rye beers, other than the rye itself. In fact, even the rye can vary. New malts are appearing, such as crystal rye which give a new flavor dimension to beers - crystal rye provides some of the spiciness of malted rye with dark fruits, and a pleasant dryness in the finish. This means the brewer can make a rye beer from:


malted rye
flaked (unmalted) rye
crystal rye


Rye is becoming at least as versatile as wheat, if not in fact more so. While most Wheat beers focus on the esters and phenolics produced by the yeast (banana/clove), Rye beers have the freedom to exploit the full spectrum of beer flavors and are not constrained by adherence to a particular style entrenched in tradition. 

But will you like some other rye beer having tried one?

If you don't like the taste of rye in beer, then there's a good chance you won't like most rye beers, since the rye flavor is most likely going to be present. However, if you do like the taste of rye, there is still no saying up front that you will like any rye beer simply due to the diversity of beers that can be brewed with rye.

what is best for the beer
what is best for the tasting scenario


For the beer, a serving size that is appropriate should:


provide sufficient beer to not warm up excessively in the cup or glass in the minute or two tasting is underway. This means serving sizes should be at least 60ml/2 oz. (If the beer is served too cold, leave it in the bottle to warm, so that all samples are poured together and tasted at the same temperature.)


For the tasting situation we have to consider:


There may be a limited amount of an evaluation beer to share between the number of judges so serving sizes should be restrained. 
Furthermore, some additional beer should be left over in case a re-evaluation is necessary. This is particularly important with styles where volatiles are a key contributor, since they dissipate quickly, plus the olfactory sense quickly becomes tired, requiring a pause and then a fresh sample.


Taking these two into account gives a typical serving size in the order of 3-4oz/75-100ml.

Note that the glass can be larger - particularly a long tall glass is good for capturing the aromatics of a smaller sample.

The reason has nothing to do with alcohol content or getting drunk (some beers like Belgian tripels, imperial stouts, or barley wines can easily clock in at a higher ABV than wines). It's got more to do with the human tongue itself and how taste buds are organized on the tongue. Essentially, beer is a much more complex drink; beer tasters use all of their taste buds while wine drinkers may only use a select few. So when you drink beer, you're not going to be overwhelming any set of taste buds unevenly while you run that risk when drinking wine.  Generally when drinking wine, you're only using your sweet and sour sets of taste buds. For instance, I don't know about you, but I've never really had a bitter wine. I've had sweet or sour wines, but never bitter or salty wines. On the other hand, I've had all of that with beer. 

If you look at the diagram of the tongue below, you'll notice that the bitter taste bud receptors are on the back of the tongue. In order to reach these receptors and taste the beer to its fullest, you must swallow the beer.

In theory, larger bottles mean that the little bit of air trapped at the top of the bottle is smaller compared to the volume of beer than it would be in a standard 12 oz bottle.  However, I've been unable to find any research backing this up, and anecdotally it makes no difference.

Larger bottles are favored for aging beers mostly for practical reasons:


Stores are more willing to sell a single large bottle (whereas many often require the purchase of an entire six-pack for smaller beers)
It's easier to share a large bottle, which you often want to do with a good beer you're aging
They're often (but not always) cheaper than the equivalent beer split up between several smaller bottles.

Also, beer isn't generally as alcoholic as wine, so the risk of getting drunk on a taste is lower.  Although some beers can be in the 10-12% range, the average abv is much lower.

Further, although the idea of a tongue map has been relatively discredited in scientific circles, it was taught in schools for a long time.

Strong Beers: like such as barleywines, robust porters, and imperial stouts. It is benefical if a beer is 8-10 percent or stronger, since an elevated alcohol profile will typically become smoother, mellower and more agreeable. That does not mean lower alcohol percentage beers can not be aged, but higer percentage beers are more suitable most of the time. 
Dark Malt: like Palo Santo and World Wide Stout. Darker, maltier beer is better because the sweet, residual sugars tend to soften over time. Even lower-alcohol beers with a malt-heavy profile will age better. 
Wild Beers: living organisms change the beer as it ages in the bottle. Orval Trappist Ale is a classic example. The Belgian pale ale receives a dose of Brettanomyces yeast as it goes in the bottle. The yeast can live in the bottle for years, slowly consuming sugars and protecting the beer’s existing flavors by consuming oxygen. Over time it goes from being bright and hoppy to bready, earthy and spicy. But sometimes they are unstable, because the yeast rapidly works through a beer and alters its character.

Canned/bottled beer has a longer shelf life than keg beer. Canned/bottled beer has a shelf life of roughly 45-60 days, whereas a keg is only 25-40 days 1.

This means that worst case scenario for comparison you could be tasting a 2 month old canned beer versus a 3 week old draft. It can cause a difference in taste, there is a ""freshness date"" after all. (See this excellent answer from @mdma for more information on what happens as beer ages)

But where does this date come from? Almost all imported retail beer is pasteurized. The reason for pasteurizing the beer is from a business standpoint. It basically allows the beer to last longer and be shipped at room temperature (this applies to kegs, cans, and bottles). 

An alternative to the pasteurization process is bottle conditioning. Most domestic beers follow this path. Essentially this process involves beers being sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant 2.

So basically the probability that the beer begins to ferment is higher over time. A canned beer and a keg beer can taste the same if they both left the brewery at the same time, and both experienced the same conditions during the time it took them to reach you. It is just that kegs have a better chance of taking less time and of being better preserved.

From a practical standpoint though, bottles can cause broken glass, kegs weigh close to 50 lbs. full, and cans allow for shotgunning. Make sure your container of choice fits your environment :)

To fully experience the flavor of beer, one must swallow it. This is because, unlike the vast majority of wine, beer is carbonated (albeit to varying degrees). When you swallow beer, some of the carbonation escapes the liquid as gas, and actually rises up from your throat into your nose (or, at least, into your nasal passages), carrying with it some of the flavor molecules of the beer. Thus your sense of smell combines with your sense of taste to produce an overall sense of flavor in a manner that is different from what occurs when you drink (uncarbonated) wine.

If you spit out your beer, you're ruining the experience.

(This explanation is based on one that I heard years ago from a brewmaster at Anheuser-Busch. I can't remember his exact words, but you get the gist.)

On a side note, regarding the important relationship between taste and smell, I'm sure you will see tasters at both beer tastings and especially wine tastings swirl their drink a bit to smell it from the glass before tasting it. The difference is that carbonated beverages pack a smell double-whammy coming at you after you swallow.

If you wanted to increase the electrolyte level, you could experiment with adding small amounts (e.g. 1/8tsp) of these salts, since they also have an effect on the taste of the beer (so makes for an interesting taste experiment!):


Calcium Chloride (CaCl) - rounds out and softens the beer emphasizing the malt
Calcium Sulphate (CaSO4) - makes the hop bitterness crisper 


However, eating some commonly available foods is even more effective at replenishing electrolyte levels, simply because they contain so many, and is better for you than the typical sports drink that contains a lot of sugar to cover the taste of the salts. 

Also keep in mind, that beer is a diuretic, so you should drink water prior to and after drinking beer to avoid further dehydration after your exercise.

Also, there are a number of books on the subject, of which breweriana helpfully lists a few.

Finally, the BCCA is the largest organization around beer can collecting, and have a lot of resource son the subject.  You can use their site to find a local chapter and ask someone about your specific collection in person.



To expand on this a little, here is a really quick guide:


If it's from the mid 70s or so on, it's probably not that valuable.  Exceptions sometimes include aluminum cans, cans with punch tops, and cans with cone tops.
If it's in poor condition, it's probably not worth much unless it's quite rare.  Unless it's better than ""grade 2"" (defined as ""Has a clean label, but there may be rust or other blemishes near the seam, the lid, or the bottom. Colors may be irregular""), it's probably not valuable.
American OIs (opening instructions, named after the instructions that came with them on how to open them) can be worth $35 to $1000.  Most others before the 70s will have a chance of being between $10 and $500, depending on their rarity.

Prior to the bill passing, only 12 ounce, 16 ounce or 32 ounce packaging was allowed. This prevented most craft beers from entering the state and to allow those entry, the law enacted stated that anything under 32 ounces or over 1 gallon would now be allowed.

The unintended side affect of this law was that anything in between that range was still banned, including the 64 ounce container. 3 years ago, there was a bill written which would allow the sale of a 64 ounce container in Florida, but it was not sent to the floor for a vote because it involved other caveats with regards to craft breweries in the state. The main reason a vote was not taken was that the legislature felt that there should be more consideration taken to assist the craft brewers. Although that bill was stopped, the movement is still ongoing to have these container sizes legalized.

Other beers, mostly heavier abbey beers allow for prolonged storing. For instance an Orval changes taste quite drastically once you have stored it for about 1 - 2 years. I've even seen these beers being stored for 30 years and still being drinkable (although you needed to pour it very carefully as there was a lot of cediment).

How long a bottle conditioned beer can be aged for and, thus how soon you should drink, comes mainly down to 


the alcohol percentage - stronger beers age better, and

While a light beer may be best consumed within 5 years, darker beers can be aged much longer than that.

While it's hard to predict the future, we can infer from the past.  As it stands, beer cans as old as 40 years are pretty much worthless (with a few exceptions).  This is because right around the mid 70s, beer can collection as an activity exploded.  Beer cans before that point became valuable, but beer cans from after that point were heavily collected (up through the present day), and are therefore pretty low value.

TLDR: There exist too many well-preserved beer cans from the current era for them to be worth anything in the next 20 years at least (and probably well through the next 40-60 years).

That's just the cans, though.  Exceptions might be very specific beers known to be age-able for decades.  Unfortunately, most beers just don't age that long.  Even a hearty barely wine usually peaks, at most, after a couple years.  The Stone Vertical Epic 020202 series was meant to be aged 10 years, which is unusually long for a beer.

If you could find a beer you reasonably believed would improve over the course of several decades, you might be able to get some money out of it if it were stored properly.

Some companies may wax dip their beers as well, in many cases wax dipping is more for aesthetics but can also help minimize oxygen exchange for periods of long storage.

Only certains beers are suited for aging, such as some lambics, saisons, Belgian quads, and high ABV stouts and barleywines, to name a few.  Even for some of these it may be noted to cellar for no more than 3-5 years.

For long term aging you also need to maintain temperatures in the range of 55°F.  This temperature should be held consistently with any major swings up or down being avoided.

  DESCRIPTION: A drink of ale, chicken broth, &amp; sack 
  
  To make Cock-Ale. 
  
  Take eight gallons of Ale, take a Cock and boil him well; then take
  four pounds of Raisins of the Sun well stoned, two or three Nutmegs,
  three or four flakes of Mace, half a pound of Dates; beat these all in
  a Mortar, and put to them two quarts of the best Sack: and when the
  Ale hath done working, put these in, and stop it close six or seven
  days, and then bottle it, and a month after you may drink it.


And PS: the Guinness meat story because of finding rats in the fermentation tanks or barrels is a myth. Or to put it another way, even if it did ever did happen once, it's not practiced now. It's hard enough for bacteria to get into the fermentation tanks or barrels, let alone something as big as a rat! (Nowadays they use stainless or aluminum kegs.)

For definition's sake, though arbitrary, let's say a ""major airport"" is one which


serves more than 5,000,000+ passengers per year (""enplanements""),
or serves the most passengers per year in its country.


So, outside of the U.S., check the airport's Wikipedia page for the stats—for example Berlin's Schönefeld Airport, with 7,000,000+ enplanements in 2010. Also eligible are airports like Luxembourg's main airport, serving less than 5,000,000 passengers per year, but the most in its country. If this definition seems to rule out some rather important airports, we can modify the rules.

This list would probably help me with ""tiebreaking"" when I can't decide what flights I'd rather take. It would also give me a reason to enjoy longer-than-desired connections :-)

Health Canada amended its food labelling requirements in September 2004 such that fining agents derived from fish, milk and egg, used during the manufacture of standardised alcoholic beverages, would be exempt from the allergen labelling requirements.
In Japan, Fish is not included on the list of allergens requiring mandatory labelling, with only certain fish species being recommended for labelling.  However, alcohol beverages and related products are not subject to the allergen labelling requirements, so wouldn't be covered anyway.

  Snake Venom is the world’s strongest beer as of 24 October 2013, coming in at 67.5%. It is dark amber in colour with no carbonation due to the high ABV. Unlike the previous Armageddon, the alcohol is not masked in Snake Venom. It is highly present yet it still tastes like a beer with a good degree of hop profile. Each batch is tested by the brewery before bottling and random batches are tested externally.


An alcohol content of 67.5% is not something I would associate with beer. So, why is this considered one and not a spirit?

Dictionary.com defines beer as


  an alcoholic beverage made by brewing and fermentation from cereals, usually malted barley, and flavored with hops and the like for a slightly bitter taste.


This is not a very restrictive definition and would seem to also apply to whisky if you add some hops to it. So, is there a better one?

591,2,,2014-02-11T04:07:45.380,21,,"Snake Venom is beer not a spirit because spirits are distilled. Beer is technically not distilled. 

As the definition you cited says, beer is the product of fermenting sugar derived from cereal grain which is dissolved in water. So water + grain + yeast = beer. The grain has to undergo a saccharification process where the carbohydrate chains (starches) in the grain are transformed into sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose...) which is then converted into alcohol by yeast. Fermentable sugar is extracted from barley through malting and mashing. The yeast is generally added to the wort (unfermented sugary water) manually by the brewer or wild yeast can fall into the beer from the air. 

Other processes may be involved with fermenting other grains. For example, in sake brewing, koji (a type of mold) is grown on rice (and soybeans) before fermentation in order to convert starches into fermentable sugars, as rice does not contain the enzymes needed to convert its starches into sugars (note: sake is generally not consider beer, but there are beers made with significant quantities of rice, up to 100% rice beer is possible).

Hops is not a necessary ingredient in beer, and beer was made for thousands of years before people started adding hops to it. 

These strong beers like Snake Venom are generally brewed to this high ABV level through freeze ""distillation."" This isn't really distillation, because no heat is involved, so people still call them beers. But this is a concentration process similar to distillation. Alcohol has a lower freezing point than water, so when you freeze beer, you can remove the ice and you're left with a more concentrated beer. This is the process used in the German eisbock style. The brewers also start with a high ABV beer, using special ingredients (sugar sources other than malt, like table sugar) along with strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol and still continue to live and ferment. This process can be somewhat difficult and expensive, so it gets attention. In my opinion it's a novelty, but I guess people like it, because they sell a lot of it.

Quoting from the Beer Judge Criteria:


  Aroma: Complex with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate
  fruity esters and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery,
  sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus
  fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana
  character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop
  character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in
  intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is
  light. No diacetyl.
  
  Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.
  Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in
  characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.
  
  Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a
  soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.
  Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes
  lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.
  Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.
  Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop
  bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and
  bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No
  diacetyl.
  
  Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the
  substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high
  carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but
  little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy
  character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.
  
  Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but
  slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded
  malt flavor but should not be sweet.
  
  Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The
  best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and
  attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the
  perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30
  IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented
  in the bottle”).
  
  History: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at
  Westmalle.
  
  Ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of
  this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white
  sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast
  strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics
  and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation
  temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if
  used, should not be recognizable as such. Fairly soft water.

600,2,,2014-02-13T14:54:30.793,11,,"First, to clear up the myth.   European beer is not served warm.  Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  

To answer your question:  Mulled beer is heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn't need to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     

As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.  The characteristics I'd look for would be a heavy body, more malty than hoppy, a bit of sweetness, and if present, dark fruit (plumbs, figs, raisins) or berries.

It may depend, though; Chimay yellow label has a note of bitterness that I don't find in, say, a Westmalle.  

Part of it depends on what you're used to.  If you're used to mass-market beers you will find these very different.  Heavier and more substantial.  Richer, more luxurious.  Very much not something you quaff down a few at a time to quench your thirst; these are savored.

Westmalle produced the first dark beer in 1856 named ""Dubbel"" (the recipe was changed in 1926). Dubbels are dark in color, and tend to have malt flavors dominating over hops. Whereas the Quadrupels have more of a fruit presence, the Dubbels tend to be a bit spicier with strong caramel flavors. They tend to have an ABV of 6.5-9.0%.

But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and evidence from these cultures (ancient China, Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big stone and earthenware pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.

So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like Dogfish Head's ancient ales), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)

There is one ""modern style"" (e.g. a style you'd find in the BJCP style guide), that can be served with no carbonation, namely straight (unblended) lambic. Several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. Sahti also has very little carbonation.

But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there's some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like chicha in Latin America (Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer) and umqombothi in South Africa. There are other names for similar beers in other regions. These are typically homebrewed.

At a bar, draft is usually placed opposite bottled, meaning like you said that the beer is pushed using gas from a keg or drawn via vacuum from a cask.  This is the actual meaning of draft.

But..

On bottles and cans it most often means ""Like-Draft"", or the marketing department's way of telling you this beer tastes more like the version of our beer that you get when you go to bar and get off the tap, but in the comfort of your own home.  

For a beer like Guinness or Boddingtons, this means a widget to hold high pressure Nitrogen gas to simulate the effects of a ""Beer Gas"" pouring system which uses a high pressure mixture of Nitrogen and CO2.  Guinness has actually replaced the widget in some of their ""draught"" packages as well, I believe the draught bottles.

But for a beer like Miller Genuine Draft, or the other Japanese beers you're mentioning, it just means the beer is unpasteurized which gives it a flavor more like what you get from a fresh, unpasteurized keg rather than a pasteurized and/or filtered bottled beer.  This is in line with the meaning of ""nama"" as you mentioned, as the beer is more ""fresh"" than traditional bottled beer.

624,2,,2014-02-18T18:05:14.537,32,,"TL DR; No.

Beer flavor changes over time (hops fade away, oxidation takes hold, etc.), and this process happens more quickly at warmer temperatures than colder ones. But there are no additional chemical reactions caused by temperature changes, so warming to room temperature and re-chilling multiple times is not going to have any added effects on the beer. Assuming you are drinking it within a few weeks, you won't notice the difference with bottled or canned beer.

I think this myth took hold from left-over kegs after parties: A half-empty keg that was dispensed by pumping air into it will start to oxidize much more quickly since oxygen is being added to it. When it warms the oxidation speeds up and it tastes stale within a day or two. Keeping it cold slows that down a bit, but even cold it won't last very long. A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.

In all of this, I am referring to room temperature. Beer left in a car in the sun for hours will start to stale much more quickly, even if bottles are protected from the sunlight. You won't get the skunky flavor caused by the light, but it will taste stale.

628,2,,2014-02-20T15:22:03.473,5,,"A Belgian Double is an amber/brown beer of usually 6-7.5% ABV (They can drift higher).  The style was most likely originated at Westmalle in the mid 19th Century.  While Trappist abbeys tend to be the origin and driver of the style, many secular Belgian breweries produce them as Abbey beers which may have actually been a brewing monastery at one point or simply as a Dubbel.  They're not as popular amongst American brewers as triples though.

As far as flavor profile, it's a malty but dry beer.  The Belgian abbey yeast strains will ferment the beer fairly dry but will create a whole host of fruity esters and spicy phenols that will add to the mid range caramel malts.  Many of the Trappist versions have attenuation of 80%-90%.  Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red Label, New Belgium Abbey, St. Martin Brune are all good examples of the style.

With regards to AudiFanatic's answer, In this case, Beer Advocate is wrong in their description of a Triple. Triples do NOT use 3x's the malt as a Single.  No brewer will tell you that, nor is it true historically.  Malt extraction is linear, meaning 3x's the malt will be 3x's the alcohol.  The closest you get to that is historically when the single was the 3rd running (like a small beer). With this method, the 1st run had triple the fermentables extracted than the 3rd run.

And while I may only be a blogger, with 13 years of industry experience, I spoke with highly trained brewmasters and read references written by authoritative experts.  I'm pretty sure my answer article is more accurate than the Beer Advocate's, in this case.  Also, the flavor profile of a triple does not have ""flavors similar"" to a dubbel.  Dark malt and light malt will give very different flavors. The only Triple that has similar flavor is Stift Engelzell's triple, which is a unique dark triple, as they're labeling it.

630,2,,2014-02-21T07:45:56.187,6,,"International Bittering Units (IBUs) are a measure of bitterness in a beer.  As such, the distinguishing factor is bitterness.  :)

Since hops are the primary contributor to bitterness in beer, high IBU beers also tend to be hoppy (although that's not always the case, since hops added at certain points in the brewing process contribute mostly to bitterness, while hops added at other points contribute mostly to hop aroma and flavor).

As an aside, heavier beers (specifically, those with lots of malt) will taste less bitter than a lighter beer with the same IBU.  To elaborate:


  there is still the complication that IBUs do not really correlate with perceived bitterness because other aspects of beer affect the perception of bitterness. For example, two beers containing 25 IBUs will be perceived very different with respect to bitterness if one beer had an O.G. of 10 °Plato and finished at 1.5 °Plato and the other beer had an O.G. of 12.5 °Plato and finished at 2.5 °Plato. Begin varying the malt bill by adding crystal malt, for example, and changing the content of various water salts and things become even muddier. This is the reason that measures like the IBU are extremely useful when used within a population of similar beers, but not so handy when looking at very different populations.

Most just work it out from the hops they add using hop bitterness calculators, rather than it being an actual measurement of the bittering compounds in the beer. For highly hopped beers, the calculated IBUs can be far off compared to reality - above around 100 IBUs it becomes more and more difficult to increase the IBUs of the beer.

The isomerized alpha acids that give the bitterness are only marginally soluble in wort (they are hydrophobic), and their solubility decreases as more is dissolved: solubility decreases with lower pH and dissolving the iso-acids lowers the pH, so solubility is self-limiting. 

Thus, labels with over 100 IBUs should not be considered accurate, unless the brewer has specifically measured the IBUs in the beer, rather than guessed them from the hop regime.

The origins of the yard of ale date back to the early 17th century, during the reign of King James I (1603-1625). Glass-making in England was then in its infancy; the first glass-making factory had only recently been established. Many of the first yard glasses have not survived due to their brittle nature, until George Ravenscroft (1674) introduced a new glass process known as the flint glass.
The yard of ale was made and used not for normal drinking purposes, but for feast and manly displays of prowess. During Anglo-Saxon times through the Middle Ages, the English nation has always engaged in the traditions of heavy drinking. As put in Young’s quote “England’s Bane” written in 1617, “He is a man of no fashion that can not drink by the dozen, by the yard, so by measure we drink out of measure.”
Legend suggests that the yard was also used in old England to serve the driver of a coach. Upon arriving at their destination and relieving its passengers, the coachman would stay and the length of the yard glass would allow him some refreshment.

Some of the same information is repeated in Wikipedia.
I'm certain that most of the history of using this style of vessel comes from fellow drinkers trying to show each other up at parties, but aside from the sheer volume (and perhaps limitations of glass-making artisans), how did this length and volume of the glass first come about?  Is there more definitive evidence for the year of birth of the yard, besides the milestone in their history of the introduction of flint glass?
I'm also curious about whether the volume of the glass was satisfying to stagecoach drivers because of their need to wait long periods for their passenger, or whether it was just easier to hand them a tall glass as they remained in the seat.

Small beer got a little stronger a few hundred years later when it came to America.  George Washington's famous 1757 Small Beer has been estimated as a little stronger, around 4-4.5% ABV by recreations.  Another famous historic small beer recipe from 1820 has been estimated around 3.8% and included lemon peel, clove, ginger, and cream of tartar for acidity in addition to hops.

Basically it runs the same gamut as session beer does today, maybe staying a bit towards the lower end of what we'd consider session.

On one point, the post is quite consistent: there isn't any real evidence to suggest that the story of the stagecoach or mailcoach driver drinking from the yard-glass is true. 

It mentions sources on the history of glassmakers:


  The same absence of evidence occurs in specialist books on drinking glasses. The history  of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers, published in 1898, has a drawing of the Eton  “long glass”, but no coach drivers.


And also the history of coaches:


  Specialist books on coach travel also fail to supply references to coach drivers and ale-yards.


The coach explanation appears to be wholly made-up:


  The earliest reference to the coach driver legend I have found is from 1952


And, inferring from previous evidence provided by the author, this is almost a century after coach travel has been superseded by steam trains.

The author also makes an interesting point; a coach driver was almost certainly not handed a yard of ale from the alehouse window, because the risk of breaking the glass (which would have been expensive) was too great!

Most of the evidence of the post tends to suggest that the yard of ale was originally intended as a bit of a joke, and attempting to drink the whole thing without spilling a drop was a fun game to play.


  When air reaches the bulb it displaces the liquor with a splash, startling the toper, and compelling him involuntarily to withdraw his mouth by the rush of the cold liquid over his face and dress.


To summarise, in one final quote from the most-excellent article:


  But with all that, I hope you’ll agree, we have found no evidence that
  the yard of ale was originally “designed to meet the needs of
  stagecoach drivers” in a hurry. In fact, there is no evidence that the
  yard of ale was ever used to refresh coach drivers at all (and if it
  had been, it certainly wouldn’t have been handed up to the driver
  through an inn window, which would be an excellent way to either spill
  the ale or smash the glass). Instead, I think, it seems clear that the

646,2,,2014-03-01T03:42:01.743,6,,"First, let me state that I'm a 4th generation Italian American; I know nothing about Russian customs other than what I learned in a Russian history class (humanities requirement) a few semesters ago. With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).

Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  

Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called Medovukha, which is made with honey and yeast. It's apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you've got Russian honey cakes and other food based items. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it's antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. 

So I'd be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn't use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I've used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.



Perhaps some substantiating points:


Baltika Medovoe Light seems to be a popular ""first Russian beer"" to try. It's a pale lager with natural honey added.
Indeed honey does seem to have played a central role in Russian culture.


  Like the Assumption, the three ""Saviors"" (Spas), August 1, 6, and 16, were associated with the fruits of the earth. The first was called the ""Honey"" (medovyi) or ""Wet Savior"" (mokryi Spas), signifying either the gathering of honey or the religious procession and blessing of the waters traditional for this day.


Ivanits, L. ""Russian Folk Belief."" [http://books.google.com].


  According to Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevskii (1841–1911), we must learn about the Russian forest, river and steppe in order to understand the Russian people. [...] ""The forest provided the Russian with oak and pine to build his house, it warmed him with aspen and birch, it lit his hut with birchwood splinters, it shod him in birch bast sandals, it gave him plates and dishes, clothed him in hides and furs and fed him honey. The forest was the best shelter from his enemies.""


Riordan, J. ""Russian Fairy Tales and Their Collectors."" [http://books.google.com]

It's notable how closely intertwined honey and their ideals of paradise were, as found by a search for the term ""honey"" in ""The Paradise Myth in Eighteenth-century Russia: Utopian Patterns in Early Secular Russian Literature and Culture"" (Baehr, S. L.).


So, though still conjecture, it may be so that Russian culture has had a higher demand for honey notes in their foods and beverages, naturally selecting those tastes.

Frankly, it may simply be the case that there's not an objective (""provable"") answer to this question.

To summarize, lambics are exposed to wild yeast (rather than the usual cultivated yeasts) and tend to have a dry, tart taste.  These are not heavy-bodied beers, nor are they bitter.  (Hops are used for their preservative effect, but old, dry hops are used to minimize the flavor impact.)

Frequently, lambics (like the one you had) have fruit added later in fermentation.  Common fruits for this include raspberry, peach, and cherry, and I've also encountered apple.  The sweetness you're tasting probably comes from the fruit (and some of these varieties taste sweeter to me than others).  If you'd like to try a lambic that doesn't have the fruit, which is likely to be less sweet, look for ""gueuze"".

Temperature affects how rapidly carbon dioxide dissipates from the beer, so the more carbon dioxide it starts with, the colder I would serve it, in order to preserve it in its intended state for as long as possible.

My personal taste would also entail a slightly cooler temperature for pale ale styles (lighter in colour and body and hoppier) and slightly warmer for brown ales, bitters, stouts and so on.

I would also like to register my objection to the term 'warm' used for beer. I don't know of any drinking culture that really does encourage the warm serving of beer in any normal understanding of the word. 'Warm' really refers to cellar temperature rather than refrigerator or just-above-zero temperature. A similar temperature to that you'd expect in red wine would be appropriate for the 'warm' beers.

You can see the style discription in the answer of Schleis. But if you want to know what to expect, try Westmalle Triple, it's a good (my preferred) benchmark.

In Belgium it's not a style. It's merely a label to mark that more ingredient were used, comparatively with the other beers within the same brewery.
A little history:
The ingredients to make beer were expensive in the middle ages, so the brewers tried to use as little as possible for there beer. There was however also an market for more tasteful, more expensive, beer. To differentiate between the brewed barrels they used X for the cheap bear, XX for the expensive one. Not saying that there were double the ingredients in it, just more. Later came also XXX. You can still find these X's on some labels these days.
The name Triple is a more recent appellation (1930's), but it is based on the same idea.
A classic trio you find in Belgium, but with a lot of exceptions, is a blond(X), a brown (XX, double) and a strong blond ale (XXX, triple). These are relative references, within the brewery and like already mentioned, more ingredients, not doubling or tripling the amount of ingredients. Making the beers stronger in alcohol and taste.

I guess you now also know what to expect with a quadruple...

As for retail establishments, there do seem to be some non-brewery bars that offer growlers, (see Ducali Pizzeria and Bar on this list) but those may be for on-premise use.  There was a proposal for a bill to allow on-premise / off-premise licensees to do growler fills but as far as I can tell, it died in committee, primarily due to strong opposition from craft brewers who were worried it would cut into their bottle profits.  


  Beyond issues of distribution, the joint legislative committee also heard from industry members interested in allowing both on- and off-premise retailers to fill beer containers up to 64 ounces for take-away and off-site consumption. The bill, sponsored by Representative William Pignatelli, has caused some division in the industry between retailers and small brewers. “We think it would be a disaster for our business by cannibalizing our bottle sales, our only real income source,” says one small Massachusetts brewer. “We for one couldn't thrive in a situation where the profit on bottled beer transfers from brewery to store or bar.”

However, all tripel beers are different from each other so there is not a real way of describing them. In general bitter, but there are sweeter tripels as well...

The difference in taste between blonde and tripel beers in general is that tripel beers have far more flavors (= more expensive) than blonde beers. The sad thing is that blonde beers are very popular and I don't even know why... Tripel beers have way more flavors :).

I know some beers in the 10% to 12% range, like the Dutch het Kanon (""the canon"") by Grolsch at 11.6% and Grand Prestige by Hertog Jan at 10%, both of which I like. They have a bit of a sweet caramel-like flavour, but I'm not sure if that related to the amount of alcohol in any way.

Also a fact, beers like Westvleteren (that won a lot of prizes) are even in Belgium (where it is brewed) pretty rare and hard to get. Basically you have to go to the Abbey yourself to get some beer. If you're there, you only get ONE crate (6 beers) per person. I was lucky enough to visit Westvleteren a while ago and found out that in the nearby cafe you also could buy one crate per person, however there were only about 100 crates available that day and only one type was available. You can drink all types though by ordering it to drink in the café (3 types).
If you would ever want to taste Westvleteren but cannot find it, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 is a very similar beer. I've heard that it is brewn exactly the same way but with some slight differences.

693,2,,2014-03-25T00:14:44.537,8,,"Wikipedia's article leads to several sources that substantiate what @ValentinGregoire preempted. For example, Chimay put up a series of short video clips that take us through surprisingly up-to-date facilities capable of bottling up to 40,000 bottles a day! (Probably it's just my own prejudices—associating monks and monasteries with old times, thus old technologies—causing surprise in my case.) With many other competing beers, and demand checked by relatively higher prices, the abbey alone suffices.

The volume produced, according to this 2012 article, is 120,000 hectoliters of beer annually, or 16,000,000 bottles (750 mL) of beer. To put this in some perspective, according to this 2008 article St. Bernardus at the time was exporting to 20 countries and producing 13,000 hectoliters (considerably lesser than Chimay) annually. And as @ValentinGregoire started saying, Westvleteren is difficult to find because the monks of the abbey of Saint Sixtus decided not to increase production despite the beer's popularity, and thus produce only 4,800 hectoliters according to a 2005 publication.

For me, it's hard to grasp such large numbers in any meaningful way. I looked up Stella Artois' production figures (and not because it's Belgian—it was just the first popular, global beer to come to mind), and found that in 2012 they produced a little over 10,000,000 hectoliters that year. Divide that by Chimay's 120,000 hectoliters per annum. Can I believe that 83 units of Stella are being consumed for every 1 equivalent unit of Chimay? Meant only as a sanity check and not any rigorous argument, it checks out as believable to me—after all, Stella's on draught all over the U.S. (I can't speak for other countries but I'm sure everywhere else too).

696,2,,2014-03-27T19:47:31.307,6,,"From what I understand, Shandies as we see them now are more similar to the German Radler.  Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn't hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn't confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to ""sessionize"" and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: Lena Christ: Erinnerungen einer Überflüssigen - Kapitel 20. I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that's more like a carbonated lemonade than what we'd think of as soda.

Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.

As to their reputation, if you'll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel's and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn't ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren't even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they'll become more accepted.

That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer.

German-style lagers are almost exclusively recommended to be served no lower than 6°C (43°F)no higher than 9°C (49°F), but I often find that the last (and warmest) mouthfuls from a glass actually have the most flavour - but I would always start with the lager cold when possible.

Real ales are a different story. On the continent of Europe there still seems to be a myth that British drink their beer 'luke-warm', but if served at that temperature most Brits would complain (and maybe continue to drink it while complaining). I believe the phrase 'serve cool' rather than 'cold' applies. Some live, bottled beers actually suffer from being too cold. On of my favourites, Black Sheep Ale develops a 'chill haze' - going a little cloudy if left in the fridge too long. 13°C (55°F)is about right for such beers.

As you suspect, the bowl shaped glass helps to concentrate the aroma.  However, this isn't unique to the snifter as many types of beer glasses incorporate a narrowing throat to provide this effect. 
Quantity.  With a glass of beer that has a particularly high alcohol content, or particularly strong flavor, you'll often get much less than a standard 12-16 oz. pour.  The beer you refer to for instance, the Big Bad Baptist, has an alcohol content of 11.8% ABV, which closer to wine than beer, (and wine has a standard 5oz serving size per glass, or thereabouts) so it calls for a smaller serving size.  However, a 5oz or 6oz serving would look rather silly in a pint glass, so a snifter is more appropriate in proportion.

You can call and make an appointment and IF you get an
appointment then you must drive there at the appointed time to pick
up your crate of bier. If you can't make it at the appointed time
then you lose out, and you must start the process all over again. I
forget how much bier this is for, but I think it is 24-48 bottles. Indeed when you make the appointment then you must supply your license place number which they use to keep track of you. They will not allow you to make 2 appointments with the same license plate number in a 60 day period. Additionally, the phone number you must call to get an appointment is always busy, I have heard of people using automatic redial for hours before they finally get through. 
If you are in the area (again you will need a car, because there is no public transport, and biking there is unreasonable from most places.) You can pop in and there is a small shop next to the monastery where you can buy a 6 pack per person without appointment, and also with out a huge price markup. Of course while you are there you can also eat some good food, and buy other items that the monks make and sell. This is much less hassle, but you cannot get much bier, so it may not be worth trekking all the way out there specifically for this.  However if you are in the area already and you have the time to take a small detour then you should certainly pop in for lunch or dinner and get some tasty brew.
Finally if you are in the Benelux region you can sometimes find Westvleteren in local shops or cafes, however the prices range from 10-16 euros per bottle (in Amsterdam) which is a lot more than you will pay at the monastery. (However, beer bought at the monastery isn't meant for selling, it's meant for private consumption, it says so every time you buy some)

In contrast, the term abbey beer is used to refer to any beers produced in the style of the Trappist monasteries.  It isn't necessarily produced by a monastery, and some beers produced by major breweries could be described as abbey beer.

The actual answer has more to do with yeast content than carbonation.  Unfiltered beers like real ale have much more yeast in suspension, and yeast has a tendency to make you gassy when digested.  Lager in general has very little yeast due to the long, cold, aging process.  I believe commercial examples are filtered as well.  In general most commercial beers are filtered, or at least have had the yeast killed off somehow, which mitigates the effect.  Real ale's major selling points are that it's unpasteurized and unfiltered, and is refermented in the cask...so it's basically got way more yeast and way more active yeast than other kinds of beer.  And then cask ales are served from a tap at the front near the bottom...near the yeast.  Basically the perfect storm of fart-induction.

Warming beer – ""stauchen"" in German –, by placing the bottle in hot water, was common in the southwest of Germany, and althought the practice has fallen out of use in recent years you can still order your beer ""gestaucht"", i.e. warmed to about 50 to 60°C (122 to 140°F), in traditional restaurants (at no extra price, of course).

Here is an image of one restaurant that uses old hot-water bottles to warm their beer as a gimmick (source):



The old gardener and his younger colleague claimed that drinking warm beer would keep away any cold that working in the wet and cold outside would otherwise bring on them. We were certainly all very healthy those two winters (and got a lot of snow shovelled), so my question is:

Does drinking hot beer prevent the common cold?

726,2,,2014-04-11T22:17:15.617,3,,"Due to differing geographic and climatic conditions, different areas of Germany specialize on different kinds of agriculture. The area to the south and west of Frankfurt is one of the major fruit producing regions in Germany (red in the map below, source):



In this area apple trees start to bloom much earlier in the year than elsewhere (source, visit link to see the progression of apple blooming over Germany):



Since people like to turn everything they produce into alcoholic beverages, fruit wines – of which (grape) wine is a just a variety – are common and popular in fruit growing regions. Most popular with everyone I know is home-made strawberry wine, but plum wine is a favourite, too, and any berry or fruit is used, with every family that owns a garden making one or two bottles of these fruit wines each autumn.

Apples are different because we grow so much more of them than strawberries or plums, and they are regularly pressed into apple juice in large quantities by the fruit grower cooperatives that sell it to the beverage industry. If you don't pasteurize the juice (for long term stability), it turns alcoholic after a couple of days, and after the apple harvest everyone gets large cannisters of freshly pressed juice from the cooperative presses, bakes onion tarts (""Dinnele""), and eats and drinks this seasonal speciality, with more or less alcohol, depending on taste.

""Most"" (must) or ""Süßmost"" (sweet must) is freshly pressed juice; once it has turned alcoholic (and sour) it has different names in different areas, such as ""Sauermost"" (sour must) and Apfelwein (apple wine).

Within southern Germany and Austria, Frankfurt is not specifically famous for apple wine, the drink, because it is drunk elsewhere, too. What the region around Frankfurt is somewhat well-known for are the festivities surrounding the end of the apple harvest and the pressing of apple juice, which have been the background theme for a musical tv show, Zum Blauen Bock (The Blue Goat Buck), that ran from 1957 to 1987. The tv studio for that show was styled like a Hessian apple wine folk fair, and the moderator gave each of the folksy musicians and other guests one ""Bembel"", the stoneware jug traditionally used to serve the apple wine in that region, for them to take home.

At that time there were only two national tv channels in Germany, and many kids grew up spending cosy weekend family tv evenings watching that show. I would guess that this is what makes Apple Wine ""famous"" (for us), but only in the special Hessian pronunciation ""Ebbelwoi"".

Note that there are exceptions. Truly non-carbonated beer, like Samuel Adams Utopias will not have a head. Hever, from what I've read, that specific example is probably more closely comparable to a fortified wine than a common beer in any case.

If you have a ""bottle conditioned"" beer -- that is, one in which live yeast are still present -- then under warmer conditions, you potentially have active yeast. To some extent, this may just increase the carbonation and alcohol content.

Under cooler conditions, the yeast will be only minimally active.

Regardless of whether your beer is ""bottle conditioned"" or not, the hop acids present from the brewing process don't respond favorably to heat or light.

It seems that some brewers are aiming to produce beer with the sole aim to be as hoppy as possible, without consideration to other flavors or characteristics. 

Is it fair to say that some beers are simply 'too hoppy' by some objective measure? I would say the New Zealand's Boundry Road Mumbo Jumbo IPA fits this category.

All beer has sugar in some form, as fermentable sugars are is what the yeast eat to turn into alcohol.  No sugar, no alcohol.  No alcohol, no beer.  

The sugar in beer primarily comes from malted barley, though other grains are often used including rye, wheat, oats, and open in the case of cheap beer, rice and corn.  In my experience, it's fairly rare to find a lager (particularly a cheap one, where they want to minimize the cost of the ingredients for a given batch) with enough residual sugar to taste sweet, but it could happen I suppose.   Sweet beers are frequently heavier, like barleywine style ales, milk stouts, and chocolate stouts. 

You can also add non-traditional ingredients to boost the amount of residual sugar in beer, and sugar itself, in a number of forms (table sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, maple syrup, etc.) is certainly one of those ingredients that is used from time to time.  Fruit is another common ingredient used to manipulate the flavor and sweetness in beer, and you'll find virtually all kinds used in various brews.  Some or the more fruits that can particularly add to the final sugar content are cherries, berries, grapes, peaches, apricots, and grapefruit.

There certainly are beers that are so bitter that they have very limited appeal and that can completely drown out other flavors rending not only the beer itself a one-note show, but eliminates the taste from anything else you eat or drink in close proximity.   Stone's Ruination is an example of this.  

So, while many aren't drawn to the ""hop-bombs"" that seem to get bigger and bigger all the time, the fact that there's a market to support them would indicate that they are not, in fact, ""too hoppy.""

The yeast died before the fermentation process ran to completion.  There are various chemicals that can do this.
The wort contained some non-fermentable sugars.  If the yeast can't feed on a particular type of sugar, then it is going to remain in the end product.  Lactose is a traditional example of such a sugar but some artificial sweeteners have a similar effect.


Assuming that the flavour was intended, I would guess that this was (2): using non-fermentable sugars allows the brewer to know exactly how much will end up in the final beer.  It is also the only option if they do in-bottle carbonation, since that requires live yeast in the bottle.

764,2,,2014-05-01T12:40:35.717,5,,"There are a few things you can check with you keg.  You said it's a home built system, yes?  So is this a mini-fridge conversion, chest freezer/keezer conversion, or some other kit?

Anyway, what length are the beer lines?  Generally you need to balance CO2 pressure against beer lines to avoid consistently foamy pours.  If your system isn't properly balanced the beer will always be foamy, on every pour.  I have 5-6 foot lines in my kegerator and it works pretty well for me, when I was having foamy pour problems everyone suggested replacing them with 10 foot lines just to make damn sure the pour wasn't too violent.  Also making sure the lines are clean.  Any beer stone or other sediment in the lines is going to cause foam.

Serving warmer with lower CO2 would also be a better step.  One frustrating thing about these sorts of adjustments is that it takes time for equilibrium to be hit.  So if you lower the CO2 pressure, the headspace is still pressurize.  You'll need to vent the keg via the pressure release valve.  Same deal with raising the temperature.  Once the beer actually comes up to the new temp, there will have been CO2 driven out of solution that you need to vent from the headspace via the pressure release valve.  It's a pain.  Regulators will also often have their own pressure valve, which you should poke and vent slightly when setting the pressure...especially when coming down since excess pressure in the system is going to mess with the reading.  So vent, watch it rise to the actual pressure, then adjust, vent again, and watch.  It takes some time but generally once you set it there's very little change required.

It's hard to tell without seeing the speed of your pour.

Definitely check the keg temperature itself.  As a homebrewer I reuse kegs, so I have stickers on all my kegs that have a little temperature line.  These liquid crystal thermometers, like this one, are pretty cheap.

You can also check the ambient temperature using a regular thermometer and a small glass of water.  You should check temperature at multiple spots inside the kegerator, so you could fill some tumblers or shot glasses with water and place them at the bottom of the kegerator, then maybe on top of the keg, and then maybe a back shelf if you have anything like that.  This lets you know if you have any hot spots which you can reduce by reorganizing tubes or tossing a small computer case fan in there.

Also, if you haven't disabled the dome light in the fridge, do so or find some way to make sure the switch stays down beyond a doubt.  When I first built my kegerator I was getting incredibly foamy pours and a huge contributor wound up being the dome light kept coming on and heating up the tops of the kegs and the beer in my lines.

Another final check is the temperature inside of the tower.  If you have no way for the cold air to get from the body of the fridge into the tower the lines in the tower will get warm and cause foamy beer, though if the CO2 pressure is set correctly, this would likely only result in the first 1-2 pours being foamy, then it calms down until the lines warm back up.  A lot of people will put fans or run copper tubes up the towers.  I filled mine with insulation.

765,2,,2014-05-01T13:37:07.153,4,,"I feel like this is a pretty opinion based question, especially with IPAs being so ""in"" right now.  Ignoring the taste of hoppiness, which is different from bitterness (dear Bob that myth needs to die), there's a limit to how much bitterness we humans can actually perceive.  Past about 100 IBUs the tongue straight up can't tell that there are any more.  Now we perceive the quality of bitterness differently.

So bitterness in beer is provided primarily by adding hops and boiling them for a long time.  The length of time and pH of the wort affects a chemical reaction called ""Isomerization"", which is the process by which Alpha Acids in hop oils become Iso-Alpha Acids which stay stably in solution and make beer taste bitter.

Similarly, there are also Beta Acids.  Generally these are in 1:1 ratio with the Alpha acids but sometimes there are more or less depending on the hop types.

Beta Acids are chemically Lupulones and Alpha Acids are Humulones.  We've identified 3 types of each as well: No prefix, Co-, and Ad-.  Most homebrewing hop packets list total alpha acid %, then % of those acids that are Cohumulone.  But straight IBUs don't take which acids were used to get to that number.

Humulone is thought to give the best, smoothest, most pleasing bitterness.  Cohumulone can be pretty abrasive, and the bitterness may seem rougher or more astringent...or just more bitter, even at the same IBUs.  Beta acids are also thought of as a ""rough"" bitterness, but they primarily produce bitterness via oxidation and can help long term shelf-stability.

I don't know what all this really helps to answer, but I guess the main points are that you can't taste past 100 IBUs, but there are qualities to bitterness that can make some beers more abusive than others.  Also my final point is that hop flavor and aroma don't make a beer bitter.  If the hops have been boiled enough to actually make a beer that bitter...you do not taste those hops.  You can have hoppy beers that are smooth and not bitter at all by hop selection, yeast selection, dry hopping, and not boiling them hops very much.  You can also make beer more bitter by yeast selection and certain grains.  You can also make Ruination or Palate Wrecker, but the point is that hoppiness and bitterness are not the same thing.

In order to perfectly enjoy the unique taste and beauty of Stella Artois, we created the Chalice, instead of merely a glass. The Chalice is designed so that every curve serves a discrete purpose to how Stella Artois should be enjoyed.
The authentic shape of the body encourages the perfect balance of C02 and liquid, enhancing head retention and flavor. The angles at the bottom cause a wave that works in harmony with the liquid alchemy. The stem provides a means to hold the chalice so that the Stella Artois stays cold longer and it's embellished with a star to honor our history.

I'm good with that in the pedantic sense that it's correct, but I wasn't intending to be quite so specific, and was merely suggesting that I was not talking about spirits etc.  It got me thinking about the definition of what could, or could not be called a beer, and whether a beer is an actual drink at all, or just the name of the group of drinks that we call beers, but which really have more specific names and definitions.

The key phrase for me, in understanding it from a simple taxonomy point of view is that alcoholic drinks are essentially either Beers Wines or Spirits.  That's my starting point, which may well be rudimentary at best and wrong at worst

Using this definition, a Mead must clearly be a beer in the most basic definition; it's certainly not a win or spirit?  Obviously under beer you then have ales, lagers, ciders, perrys, meads, stouts, bitters and probably a million others, and probably further sublevels (dry cider, sweet cider, sparkling cider....), but is there a second level ""beer"" also at this level?

Really, is there actually a single specific drink that is a beer that is not further defined as, for example, an IPA, or a Stout?

797,2,,2014-05-20T16:51:16.667,7,,"IMHO, I would classify ciders, perrys, and meads to be more like wine than beer -- they are made by fermenting fruit or honey without substantial change to the base ingredients. Beer is made from malted grain, which must first be mashed to convert starch into fermentable sugars. Beer must contain 4 essential ingredients: Malt extract (from the grain), hops, water and yeast. It may contain others as well, but if any of these four are missing it is not beer.

I think that your premise of ""that alcoholic drinks are essentially either Beers Wines or Spirits."" is wrong because it oversimplifies and excludes some beverages. Besides mead and cider, there are also malt-based alcho-pop beverages (Mike's Hard Lemon, Twisted Tea, etc.) that I would not call beer either - they contain 3 of the four ingredients, but lack hops. There are other local indigenous alcoholic beverages around the world that don't fit any of these categories, like Japanese sake.

There are many styles of beer -- so the word ""beer"" refers to all of them, and there is no style that is called just ""beer"". Here is a link that describes many styles of beer, mead and cider. Note that this is not a comprehensive list; brewers keep developing new styles all the time to create desirable products.

798,2,,2014-05-21T01:20:03.927,15,,"The first, and primary reason any beer comes in branded glassware is this:  Marketing.  Brewers, like any other businesses, like for the general public to know that the anonymous tapped beer you're drinking is theirs.  That is why they provide branded glasses to bars, and request (or require) that their beer be served in their glasses.  


  Is there a benefit to the mildly curved shape of this glass for this type of beer?


In my observations, yes, there is.  While the throat may not narrow as severely as a brandy snifter, the effect of concentrating the aroma is still achieved. Eyeballing it, I'd say that the curvature is somewhere in between that of my champagne flutes and my red wines glasses, which are presumed to have the same general effect.  More generally I'd say that a glass with a narrowing or restricted throat does concentrate the aroma, and the degree of restriction doesn't seem to matter significantly, to my nose.  (Assuming it isn't too great, that is.  Beer in a bottle or can, for instance, is definitely at a disadvantage.) 

I'd like to also look at a few of the reasons they state in their marketing material as well.  


  The authentic shape of the body encourages the perfect balance of C02 and liquid, enhancing head retention and flavor.


I don't have any evidence to back this up, but I suspect that this is probably the most legitimate of the claims.  This would have a significant effect on the experience of drinking the beer, it is going to be specific to their recipe, and it's a reason that's often given for custom beer glassware.  (Boston Beer Company laser etches the bottom of their Sam Adams Boston Lager glass to enhance cavitation, for instance.) 


  The angles at the bottom cause a wave that works in harmony with the liquid alchemy. 


I have no idea what this means.  Alchemy is the term for pre-chemistry, and primarily deals with trying to turn ordinary substances into gold.  I assume they're trying to insinuate that the glass magically turns Stella into better beer. 


  The stem provides a means to hold the chalice so that the Stella Artois stays cold longer 


This is plausible, and perhaps unfortunate.  This is why you are supposed to hold red wine glasses by the bowl (to warm the wine) and white wine glasses by the stem (to keep it cool.)   However, with wine, a serving is generally five ounces or so, compared to twelve or more of lager.   The effect certainly won't be the same given the significantly higher mass.   The unfortunate bit is that colder is not generally what you want when you're talking about good beer.  Colder is the realm of the cheap macro-brews like Coors Light.   Cold subdues flavor compounds, which is useful when the flavor of the beer is nasty, and not so useful when it's pleasant.  This certainly isn't a a requirement or general best practice for lagers as you won't find stemmed glassware used for Boston Beer's Samuel Adams Lager glass: 

 

or my classic Spiegelau Lager glass: 



or any of the glasses you'll see used for the many fine Lagers of Germany.  So, I have to suppose one of the following two reasons.  First, they may simply be pandering to the general belief that colder beer is better.  Second, it would be unfortunate if they were trying to hide a lack of quality by trying to ensure the beer was too cold to taste properly.  

Finally, and I've left this to last, because it's purely my opinion...I think they've chosen the chalice glass specifically because it's fancy, and that's the image they want to portray for their beer.  When people see the Stella glass, they don't want their beer to be lumped in with the pint-glass styles, they want it to stand out as sophisticated, and the chalice specifically gives it that cachet.   

So, my top line and bottom line are down to marketing, with a bit of truth and a bit of fiction to all the bits in between.

In the UK and a few other countries and regions organizations like CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale) run beer festivals which work out, on a pint for pint basis, cheaper when trying a wide variety of beers. Although there is usually an entry fee (at least as far as CAMRA events go) each drink tends to be cheaper and there is the option of trying more different beers by buying in half pint measures (recommended). The biggest benefit of going to festivals, however, is the range of beers available. A liquor store / off license / bar can only really stock a few different beers and these are usually ones that they can get consistently, in volume, and at either a suitable price or within their tie (don't get me started on the beer tie), whereas festivals are much freer to buy different beers from varying sources as they are one-off events and less restricted.

A second idea would be to set up a tasting club so that you can share the costs and the beers. This runs the risk (!) of making new friends as well!

In London (UK) we have a brewery producing a 2.8% abv beer (Redemption brewery, beer name escapes me) which is packed with hops and of greater hop depth than many IPAs. Batches of a beer that are brewed to be low alcohol will necessarily be different to those brewed at full strength which is why I would hope (pray?) that any brewer whose product is worth drinking would make a different beer, brewed at low strength for these markets. These beers can be as flavoursome and exciting as, if not more so than, higher strength beers.
The process to make the beer lower ABV is simply reducing the amount of sugar that can be converted into alcohol by using a lower sugar content mash either using specific lower sugar malts, using less malt, or using a yeast that will not support higher alcohol concentrations (alcohol kills yeast...!). Using less yeast won't work as the given yeast will continue to multiply to make up the shortfall. If you are not making real beer halting the fermentation early by killing the yeast with heat (or similar) will produce a lower alcohol beer but it will be sweeter as there is more unfermented sugar. Fining and serving real ale before fermentation has produced a higher strength may have a similar effect for those types of beer.
Since alcohol dissolves flavouring compounds better than water it is much harder to brew a highly flavoured weak beer but this may be offset by taste complexity.
Larger breweries will reduce alcohol levels chemically post-production by boiling off alcohol or similar. this will reduce the flavouring compounds in the beer (see GCSE fractional distillation notes or similar for details) and so make the beer taste weaker. These are produced at mass market quantities and even the full strength product is pretty awful compared with crafted or real beers.

This anaerobic bacteria is more active either before fermentation has started (either by contamination or inoculation) and after fermentation has ended. More so after fermentation this bacteria has metabolize the autolysis products of yeast.

A pale ale is an ale (a beer made with ale yeast) and lightly malted barley and adjuncts. An IPA is a pale ale that has been hopped greatly. Your particular white IPA is light in color and has 55 IBUs, qualifying it for the IPA class of beer. 

In case you are curious:
The reason IPAs were established is because the English brewers receiving spices from India made a habit of sending the would be empty ship back loaded with beer. At the time pale ales were the staple beer. At first the beer developed a bad flavor during the long voyage. English brewers learned to cover the negative flavor of their pale ales with more bittering hops. 

IBUs stands for International Bitterness Units, it is an approximation of how much bitterness you will taste.

The solution I'm partial to is the beer co-op.  Mine started as a group of coworkers; we've scattered to a bunch of different companies by now, but the co-op remains.  Every 4-6 weeks the organizer sends out email announcing a planned buy, with the goal of getting a multiple of 8 people (12 works, but we prefer 8).  Participants get a case with variety of beers and divide the total cost.  I've gotten to sample some beers I'd never have tried (or known about) otherwise.  (Most people don't participate every time, but the organizer does because, hey, beer.)

If you're doing a co-op anyway, then it's easy to add on the occasional ""side buy"" -- something that comes in 25oz bottles, or is particularly expensive, etc.  So long as there's enough interest to get the case, people can then buy them individually.

You can be very organized about this, requiring commitments in advance, or you can be flexible and deal with the occasional surplus.  People interested enough to organize co-ops usually don't mind some surplus (assuming finances aren't too tight).

One of the distributors that we use is FlyingFirkin http://www.flyingfirkin.co.uk/ , just to give you some idea of how it works.
Additionally, in the UK, duty is paid at point of sale so VAT is paid on the beer when it is bought from the supplier but duty is only applied when it is sold to the end user, or ""drinker"", and so the price paid from the supplier will be significantly lower.

843,2,,2014-06-03T13:23:29.053,7,,"The answer to this question is going to depend largely on which specific beers you are referring to.  Assuming you are referring to Becks Premium Lager (as opposed to one of their other offerings), Becks has an IBU (International Bitterness Units) of 20 where Heineken has 23 IBUs.  Based on IBUs, Heineken should be more bitter but not by much.  What you're tasting could be accounted for by batch to batch variation on behalf of the brewer or the conditions that the bottles were stored (length of storage, lighting, etc.)

Furthermore, the bitterness in most of Becks' beers come from the use of darker malts, while the majority of the bitterness in Heineken comes from the use of (pellet) hops. 
This makes the bitterness in Becks tend towards roastier flavors, and the bitterness in Heineken to tend to be more herbaceous or floral. It is possible that you are more personally sensitive to one set of those flavor compounds.

Note that IBUs are an imperfect measurement of bitterness so only consider it as an approximation.  Many people say that differences in bitterness beyond 100 IBUs are indiscernible but that is often conflicted.

844,2,,2014-06-03T16:20:41.837,3,,"It's basically because of the ingredients - the two beers contain different amounts of sweet and bitter flavors which balance out to give you the perceived bitterness.

Some will say that it's because of higher hop bitterness, measured in IBUs (International Bitterness Units), but this is really only part of the picture. You can have a beer with a larger number of IBUs but also a large amount of residual sweetness such as caramel malts) and this will generally taste sweeter than a beer that has a lower IBUs and almost no residual sweetness.

Each brewer designs a beer with a taste profile in mind, and then seeks ingredients and sometimes process changes to arrive at this desired flavor profile. This often requires several iterations until the desired result is reached, and even then it may not be possible to reach it every time, so the brewer may also choose to blend beers from different batches to arrive close to the desired result. The same is true for Heineken - their Quality Assurance team will have been given clear guidelines on the spec for the beer, both as hard and fast measurable, objective facts (IBUs, Color, carbonation, diacetyl, fusel alcohols, esters etc...) and also as subjective - how it tastes. 

So the final answer about why one beer is more bitter than another is because their respective breweries have decided that's the flavor they want, and they have crafted a brew to produce their chosen flavor profile.

863,2,,2014-06-07T06:29:46.613,22,,"The short answer is that the beer will not last long after opening, and in most cases you are best off resealing the bottle with an airtight cap/stopper that can withstand mild pressure.

Two things you want to prevent in this situation are:


oxidation of the beer, which will change the taste of a beer.
loss of carbonation.


For non-carbonated drinks such as wine, a common method to combat oxidation in an opened bottle is to remove the air from the bottle using a vacuum pump.  This is a bad idea for carbonated drinks, since the lower pressure will force carbon dioxide to out of solution causing it to go flat.  One alternative would be to replace the air with an inert gas (perhaps with a product like Private Preserve).

To minimise loss of carbonation, you really only need to reseal the bottle so it is airtight: carbon dioxide will stop coming out of solution once the pressure builds.  The smaller the air gap in the bottle the faster the pressure will build, so if it is a large bottle with only a small amount of beer left it might make sense to transfer it to a smaller bottle first.

The paper references an article --- amusingly titled Why the Schlitz Hit the Fan --- which makes the following claim:


  In 1976, new Food and Drug Administration regulations regarding which ingredients needed to be printed on the bottles prompted Schlitz to change the preservatives it used (it had been using silica gel). The company did not spend sufficient time testing the new process, and tiny green flakes appeared in the beer.


Internet sleuthing reveals this Beer Connoisseur article, which gives more info and claims that the flakes were, in fact, white:


  Schlitz decided to use another beer stabilizer instead, one that would be filtered out of the final product and thus would not have to be listed as among the ingredients. Unfortunately, what Schlitz's brewing technicians did not know was that the new anti-haze agent, called Chill-garde, would react in the bottles and cans with the foam stabiliser they also used, to cause protein to settle out. At its best this protein looked liked tiny white flakes floating in the beer and at its worst it looked like mucus, or ""snot,"" as one observer bluntly called it.


After more research, I can't find any other references to Schlitz being [literally] green. As a beer lover and homebrewer, this inconsistency is driving me nuts. Does anyone know which color the flakes in Schlitz were in the mid-1970s? I have the following hypotheses:


Beer Connoisseur also mentions that Schlitz switched from whole to pellet hops; coupled with inadequate filtration, this could have led to green flakes.
Adults doing research thought of ""snot"" like kids, which meant that a ""snotlike"" substance in beer was probably green.
This is a misunderstanding created by non-brewers reading that Schlitz was ""green"" (which does appear frequently in search results); combined with knowing that there were flakes, and that the liquid of beer is generally amber-ish, it must have been [to someone unfamiliar with ""green beer"" being beer which needs to be further aged] that the flakes were literally green.
Beer Connoisseur is wrong, and the flakes were in fact green.


Does anyone have first-hand experience with this era of beer?

Sometimes breweries will be able to sell directly to liquor stores, pubs and so on, they may also have to go through a liquor distribution board (LDB). (And as breweries expand it is most defiantly worth it to go through a LDB or other distributor, as you can't be making sales calls to the other side of a country to deliver a 20L keg.)

From my experience, businesses will generally contact or be contacted by a sales rep who will take care of them. Somewhat surprisingly, a lot of new-ish pubs and bars will actually be provided with very low cost or even free beer (or other alcohol) on the condition that only that brand will be on tap for x amount of months/years. This generally happens with bigger breweries. Pubs also will sometimes sell taps to breweries. 

In terms of cost, no, it wouldn't be cheaper for a pub to go the the local liquor store and buy the beer there (might be 20%+ more expensive). When a brewery sells to a organization (pub, restaurant, liquor store etc.) it is generally at a 18-26% discount so that it can then be marked up by the pubs at a reasonable price.

A lot of this is the same sort of way that pubs get their chicken wings, just more heavily regulated.

There are a number of varieties of barley wine (some hoppy, and some with almost no hop characteristics), but they all have a relatively high alcohol content compared to most beers.  The alcohol is produced via fermentation, the same as any other beer, and without distillation.  Note that not all high alcohol beers are necessarily described as ""barley wine"" though.

As for the legal aspects, I don't know of any regulations that specifically target barley wine.  The law usually deals with alcoholic beverages based on the alcohol content, and from that point of view barley wines would usually be treated similar to normal wines due to the similar ABV.

890,2,,2014-06-27T14:12:37.207,16,,"Beck's is a pale German pilsner brewed by Beck's Brewery headquartered in Bremen.  The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck's is wholly owned by AB InBev.

Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.  The flavor is very light and dry with only slight malty sweetness.  A little crisp hop bitterness without too much hop aroma.

Most ""macrobrews"" will be somewhat similar, though the stock ""American"" variant of Pale Lager like Budweiser or Miller will have a corn sugar flavor to them and likely be a bit lighter in body.  Beck's claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.

St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck's.

If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it's a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it's in the Pilsner style so while it's still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.  Pilsners also have a strong hop character and bitterness.

If you wanted to try local or American brewed versions just about anyone's Session Lager (Full Sail comes to mind, as does Notch if you're near MA at all) should be similar.  According to this list on BeerAdvocate you should be near Berghoff and Baderbrau which will both make traditional German styles.  Some breweries, Baderbrau included, will call their pale lager a ""Lawnmower beer"".

Branching out, Sam Adams Boston Lager is a style called Vienna Lager which may also appeal you.  Though it will be significantly maltier than Beck's.  Anything with Dortmunder in the name will also be similar, though hoppier but not like an American Pale Ale or IPA or anything.  You might also be interested in any brewery's Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch's are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.

Does that help?

There are 'pear ciders' such as Woodchuck that use the name, but as Wikipedia points out, ""A similar product made from pears is called perry but sometimes (incorrectly) called Pear Cider in the marketing of some producers' products"".  I personally can forgive this, since pears are closely related to apples, and the result is quite tasty.

The ""beer"" part of ginger beer is due to the fermentation process involved in its creation.  In this way, it is more similar to ""root beer"", since ginger is a root, like the sassafras root used in root beer and birch roots used in birch beer.  The website todayifoundout.com has a well referenced article for Why Root Beer is Called That covering the naming of root beer.  If the ginger based version isn't fermented, but is instead ginger flavouring added to carbonated water, it would be ""ginger ale""; I have no idea why, since an India Pale Ale is certainly fermented.  Even with ginger products, the differentiation is not really all that terribly strict, as noted by this Huffington Post article.  Initially, ginger beer, root beer, birch beer, etc, were frequently alcoholic, but Prohibition ruined that for the U.S.

As a bit of a side note, the alcoholic versions are making a wonderful comeback (in my personal opinion) with Sprecher's and Small Town Brewery for root beer.  I personally have not seen as much alcoholic ginger beer, but Crabbies from the U.K. is quite good.  Although I personally do not like Kuchi's ginger beer, I have several friends who absolutely love it.

  Aroma: Little to no malt aroma, although it can be grainy, sweet or corn-like if present. Hop aroma may range from none to a light, spicy or floral hop presence. Low levels of yeast character (green apples, DMS, or fruitiness) are optional but acceptable. No diacetyl.
  
  Appearance: Very pale straw to medium yellow color. White, frothy head
  seldom persists. Very clear.
  
  Flavor: Crisp and dry flavor with some low levels of grainy or
  corn-like sweetness. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels. Hop
  bitterness at low to medium-low level. Balance may vary from slightly
  malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels
  of carbonation may provide a slight acidity or dry ""sting."" No

Some beers bill themselves as a ""Pale Ale"", like Rolling Rock also use adjuncts, like rice.  This notation is designed to set them apart from those other beers.  It should be noted that the BJCP guidelines for a Pale Ale are:


  Aroma: Usually moderate to strong hop aroma from dry hopping or late
  kettle additions of American hop varieties. A citrusy hop character is
  very common, but not required. Low to moderate maltiness supports the
  hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty
  malt character (bready, toasty, biscuity). Fruity esters vary from
  moderate to none. No diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy
  notes, although this character should not be excessive.
  
  Appearance: Pale golden to deep amber. Moderately large white to
  off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear, although
  dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy.
  
  Flavor: Usually a moderate to high hop flavor, often showing a citrusy
  American hop character (although other hop varieties may be used). Low
  to moderately high clean malt character supports the hop presentation,
  and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character
  (bready, toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late
  hops and bitterness, but the malt presence can be substantial. Caramel
  flavors are usually restrained or absent. Fruity esters can be
  moderate to none. Moderate to high hop bitterness with a medium to dry
  finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into the finish. No
  diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this
  character should not be excessive.
  
  Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Carbonation moderate to high.
  Overall smooth finish without astringency often associated with high
  hopping rates.
  
  Overall Impression: Refreshing and hoppy, yet with sufficient
  supporting malt.
  
  Comments: There is some overlap in color between American pale ale and
  American amber ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner,
  have a less caramelly malt profile, less body, and often more
  finishing hops.
  
  History: An American adaptation of English pale ale, reflecting
  indigenous ingredients (hops, malt, yeast, and water). Often lighter
  in color, cleaner in fermentation by-products, and having less caramel
  flavors than English counterparts.
  
  Ingredients: Pale ale malt, typically American two-row. American hops,
  often but not always ones with a citrusy character. American ale
  yeast. Water can vary in sulfate content, but carbonate content should
  be relatively low. Specialty grains may add character and complexity,
  but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains
  that add malt flavor and richness, light sweetness, and toasty or
  bready notes are often used (along with late hops) to differentiate
  brands.

The ale house would ""pull"" pints from huge wood tanks, generally located below their taps by using traditional cask systems. CO2 was not available to breweries for most of the worlds brewing history. This led to a ale that was cellar temperature and with little to no carbonation. 

Today breweries try to replicate this process by ""cask conditioning"" carbonating naturally their beers. So, there is no forced carbonation with CO2 and generally they do not refrigerate cask ales either.

beer contains very little thiamine (B1), of which malting the barley causes a slight loss, but otherwise stays intact through the rest of the brewing operations,
riboflavin (B2) increases during the malting and brewing processes, resulting in nutritionally significant amounts (e.g. seven pints supplying total daily requirements),
nicotinic acid (niacin, B3) fluctuates throughout the malting and brewing process, but also results in nutritionally significant amounts (e.g. three-and-a-half to four pints supplying total daily requirements).

The process for making mead is more similar to wine making than brewing beer. There's no brewing (boiling) stage necessary in making mead. All of the fermentable sugar comes from the honey in mead, so you just mix honey with water (and whatever spices you want) and go directly to the fermenting stage. Mead also has a higher alcohol content than most beers (8 - 20%, which is more similar to wine, or even brandy).


  ...would it be reasonable to think a brewery I like may make, or consider making mead as well?


Not really. At least not in the U.S. Beer is much more popular than mead, and the process for making mead is different, so relatively few brewers are going to make it. I tried mead once at a specialty beer &amp; wine store, which is your best bet for finding it in the U.S. You may have to ask around to see if a store can order some for you.

In a nutshell, a growler is an open container, but it is up to the local police or state police to decide whether or not to enforce the law.

As I read the law, you are 100% legal if the growler is in the trunk of the car.

I believe this discrepancy arises from the fact that Heady Topper is a relatively well balanced IPA. It has the hops bitterness to it that IPAs do, and the high alcohol content of a double, however it also has more of a malty body to it that most people are unused to when drinking IPAs. So lots of people are shocked when drinking it that it actually has some balance between the body and the aftertaste, so that's part of what leads to the high reviews (in my opinion).

So if the opportunity comes up to try it, sure, go for it. But I wouldn't really go out of my way to chase after it - there are other well balanced IPAs out there that are more readily available.

You can get it at local bars, pubs, and restaurants for $5/can. Around $78 for a case (24 x 16oz cans). Compared to other DIPA of similar quality, it's not that expensive (sure if you compared it to macro lagers...)

There are also data from early 20-th century ethnological surveys where brewers describe their methods. Some of the equipment used for yeast transfer is still in use, or in ethnological museums.

People usually didn't brew that often, so they couldn't transfer the yeast cake itself. Instead, they would collect yeast from the previous brew and either keep it in a jar that they kept cool, for example in a well, or by drying it on a wooden log, piece of linen, straw ring, etc etc etc. There were lots of methods, but they basically boil down to either keeping wet or dry yeast. Odd Nordland's 1969 book is the only detailed source of information on this that I know; unfortunately it's near-impossible to get hold of.

As far as I know, this type of yeast and yeast use only survives in two places: the Lithuanian province of Aukstatija, and western Norway (specfically, Hardanger, Voss, and Sunnmøre).

I've written a summary of what's known of Norwegian practices, and earlier this year I was able to brew with a brewer who still uses his family's ancestral yeast strain. I've published an account of that brewing session.

It's worth mentioning up front that there are certain taste aversions that people have to different beers.  You mentioned getting her into a vanilla porter.  I have a favorite from Mill Street in Canada; they make a great vanilla porter.  The caveat though is that I like coffee a lot, and many people averse to beer tend to have trouble with the intense flavors of different varieties of beer, such as extreme hoppiness, heavily malted barley, or, darkly roasted barley that make up stouts and porters.

You mentioned less fruity beers, but talked about ""Wild Blue"" when you mentioned that.  Wild Blue is a Blueberry flavored lager; it's basically a ""regular beer,"" but is infused with blueberry flavor to change it up.  I would look at other ""fruity"" styles that are still very authentic and internationally renowned, but pack less of a general beer flavor than a filtered rice/grain/barley beer would...

A good starter would be a more heavily wheat based beer.  Styles like Belgian wheats or German hefeweizens have less of that pronounced ""regular beer"" flavor, but are still in their own right, very prolific styles.  I tend to find Belgian wheats/""weisse/wittes(whites)"" to be a bit more ""chewy"" with more of a banana/coriander flavor than their full blown German counterparts.  Good wheats that I would recommend would be Franziskaner or Hoegaarden.  They're safe forays into that style of beer that I almost always tend to get for new drinkers.  The cool thing is that if she likes them, you can really experiment with other varieties in that field.  Belgian doubles and triples tend to generally fall into a similar category, and they're arguably some of the finest beers in the world...

Belgian styles, like lambics do as well and the wild yeasts and bacteria continue to grow. However, even those have a limit -- eventually they will begin to taste very stale. 

Low gravity beers begin to taste stale much more quickly. If you are keeping them refrigerated, they may last for 6 months or more. Seven years is definitely way too long.

It is likely therefore that beers existed tens of thousands of years ago through accident at first and eventually design and were likely to be similar to traditional African beers such as the Kenyan busaa, which by coincidence is still made by my girlfriend's grandmother for the elder men of her tribe. I.e. these beers would be a form of thick, alcoholic liquid bread. In other words we cannot know who ""invented"" beer as 


it probably pre-dates written language and
it wasn't ""invented"" by anyone really it was made serendipitously at first.


the date was probably some time over 20,000 years ago but that is unknowable for the same reasons.
Interestingly, as it is a drink made from a cheap foodstuff that was widely consumed by the people rather than by nobility who could record such things, it is not known who invented lager either. It is likely that Lambics were the precursors of Lagers though.

995,1,,2014-08-19T03:53:45.563,11,1608,"Background: I was drinking a New Belgium ""Tour de Fall"" last week and thinking about the hops that I was tasting in the finish. For me, hops in general were a pretty slowly acquired taste, and I didn't start truly appreciating the hoppy West Coast style until I encountered Sierra Nevada ""Torpedo"" and fell in love.

Now I finally find myself wanting to get to know specific varieties of hops by flavor and scent. Amarillo, Cascade, and so on - I know there are dozens and dozens of varieties, but how do I start training myself to recognize their differences (and identify the most common varieties) in the drink itself? 

Should I buy some hops from a supply store, and huff 'em like a soccer mom in a fabric softener commercial? Or would that be totally different from what comes through in a beer? Would it be better to find a stool at a local brewery/brewpub and ask for a lesson in liquid form?

Also look at the Hop Variety page to get a little more information.
The thing to remember is scent doesn't always translate to taste, especially with hoppy beers such as IPA's after the beer has aged a bit. To get the taste you really need to try a beer made only with that hop (my opinion) to see what characteristics it imparts. Hop Union does have a Hop and Brew School every year for both craft (professional) brewers and home brewers.

This does require having a bottle caper and some caps, but those can be bought either at a local homebrew store or online for less than 20 dollars when you purchase the small 1oz bags of hops.

A new experiment done jointly by Stanford University and the University of Edinburgh has finally proven that when beer is poured into a glass, the bubbles sometimes go down.

&quot;Bubbles are lighter than beer, so they're supposed to rise upward,&quot;

– Richard N. Zare, the Professor of Natural Sciences at Stanford.

&quot;But countless drinkers have claimed that the bubbles actually go down the side of the glass. Could they be right, or would that defy the laws of physics?&quot;

In 1999, Australian researchers announced that they had created a computer model showing it was  possible for beer bubbles to flow downward.
But Zare and former Stanford post doctoral fellow Andrew J. Alexander were unconvinced by the virtual Guinness model and decided to put it to the test by analysing it physically.

&quot;Indeed, Andy and I first disbelieved this and wondered if the people had had maybe too much Guinness to drink,&quot; Zare recalled. &quot;We tried our own experiments, which were fun but inconclusive. So Andy got hold of a camera that takes 750 frames a second and recorded some rather gorgeous video clips of what was happening.&quot;

A careful analysis of the video confirmed findings: Beer bubbles do sink.

&quot;The answer turns out to be really very simple. It's based on the idea of what goes up has to come down. In this case, the bubbles go up more easily in the centre of the beer glass than on the sides because of drag from the walls. As they go up, they raise the beer, and the beer has to spill back, and it does. It runs down the sides of the glass carrying the bubbles -- particularly little bubbles -- with it, downward. After a while it stops, but it's really quite dramatic and it's easy to demonstrate.&quot;

The phenomenon also occurred in other beers, said Alexander

&quot;The bubbles are small enough to be pushed down by the liquid. We've shown you can do this with any liquid, really -- water with a fizzing tablet in it, for example.&quot;
&quot;It's just paying attention to the world around you and trying to figure out why things happen the way they do...&quot;

Mikkeller single hop series 
IPA is dead by BrewDog
Arbor often do single hop beers


Your mileage may vary but if you keep your eye out, hopefully you'll find a local brewer doing this kind of thing.

I've also had a couple of single yeast flights which were very enlightening.

Tastings

A couple of hops really stick in my mind because of when I had them. I remember going to a tasting of a local's brewers Galaxy IPA and he'd filled the shop with glasses of Galaxy hops and it smelled incredable.

Another time was tasting a Sorachi Ace beer by Wiper and True. It was horrific, but hearing the descriptions my fellow drinkers came up with and having the brewer explaining the history of the hop really anchored it to me. It meant when I had Little Things that Kill by weird beard, I could pick it out straight away.

Geography

The other thing that I enjoy is learning where and when and why a hop has come about. European hops are so different from American which are different again from British. Not to mention New Zealand hops which have their own aromas. Obviously it's not always consistant but being able to say what kind of region a hop tastes like is a good start!

Do they just bottle them and put them in kegs at the same time so the beer that is bottled actually ferments more or do they keep the beer for the kegs fermenting longer and then put it in kegs?

1039,2,,2014-10-02T18:36:19.843,15,,"As of today (2016), there are several microbreweries operating in Iceland. The micro- and homebrewing scene has been budding nicely in the last few years, the latest player being Segull 67.

The Breweries

In a category of their own are Borg and Einstök. These two operate under the wing of the two ""large"" local breweries (Egils and Víking), serving as their respective experimental departments. 


Borg keeps up a steady stream of new beers each year, easily Iceland's most ""prolific publisher"". They have a steady production of the big-name styles (a lager, an IPA, a porter, etc.), and nearly always one or two beers on limited/temporary release.
Einstök produces the country's most widely sold ales, and seasonal varieties.


Other microbreweries are:


Bruggsmiðjan. Founded in 2006, they are the oldest microbrewery in Iceland (yup). They produce a line of Czech-style lagers, brand name Kaldi.
Gæðingur. Their gig is essentially similar to Borg's - steady production of big name styles, interspersed with experiments.
Steðji. Their lineup is a mix of very normal German-style lagers and some truly wacky stuff - for instance, their infamous whale beer, Hvalur.
Ölvisholt Brugghús. ÖB is of the more established players, but their beers do not follow a particular trend that I have noticed. If anything, I could say they rely on beers ""with a twist"" more than the others, not many of their beers fall neatly into a common style.
Segull 67. Segull 67 is the newest and by far the smallest operating brewery. They released one beer in 2015, a dark lager.


At the time of writing, this list is exhaustive for operational breweries. In addition, I know of three breweries which will be opening ""any day now"": Hún/Hann brugghús (in Reykjavík), Austri (in the eastern part of the country) and Hið austfirska bruggfélag (also in the eastern part of the country).

Brewpubs

In addition to the breweries that sell nation-wide, there are a few who focus on their own premises.


Bryggjan Brugghús, in Reykjavík near the harbor area. The only brewpub in Reykjavík, and unlike most Icelandic ""pubs"", also operates an actual restaurant.
Brothers Brewery, in Vestmannaeyjar (islands off the south coast). It's the place to get craft beer in Vestmannaeyjar, apparently! Don't know much about it, unfortunately.
Bjórsetur Íslands, in Hólar (in the northern part of the country). This tiny establishment is the oldest brewpub by several years. It's basically run as a hobby - open on Fridays only. It is notable for its association with a beer festival (Bjórhátíð á Hólum), held annually at Hólar.




Microbrews and Craft Beers on Tap

Several bars pride themselves on selling Icelandic micro- and craft brews. These are:


Microbar. There are two bars operating under this name, one in downtown Reykjavík, the other in Sauðárkrókur. The one in Reykjavík is the pioneer of the Icelandic craft bar scene. It is owned by the Gæðingur brewery, and appropriately, you can always find Gæðingur beers on tap here (among other local beers)
Skúli Craft Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is notable for its diverse and rapidly rotating taps. At any given time, about half of them are likely to  be connected to local beers. The bar is independent, but beers from Borg brewery are always prominent in their choices. 
Bjórgarðurinn, in Reykjavík. They have 22 taps, Icelandic craft beers always among them. They serve food other than bar snacks, mostly gourmet sausages that they recommend pairing with particular beers. It is a hotel bar, not associated with a brewery.
Kaldi Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is not owned by Bruggsmiðjan, but it brands itself as a place where you can get local beer, in particular, Bruggsmiðjan's Kaldi. This is, however, not a place I would call a craft bar that prides itself on a varied selection.
R5 Micro Bar, in Akureyri. I have not visited, but it's marketing itself as a craft beer bar. The locals seem impressed!


Micro/Craft beer fans will also want to know of Mikkeller &amp; Friends Reykjavík. Large tap selection there, but no focus on local produce.

Borg and Einstök taps can commonly be found interspersed with the common Egils and Víking taps. Steðji and Ölvisholt beers are only sporadically found on taps.

Many other bars (but definitely not all) have some ambition when it comes to craft beer availability without making a particular deal of it. Hlemmur Square, a hostel/bar near the main bus station, is usually particularly well stocked. But always, ask your bartender!

Selected products

Off the top of my head, here are a few items I consider distinctive - or at least, I have not found anything quite like them abroad.


Garún. Imperial stout, more heavy on the licorice than most.
Lava. A smoked imperial stout.
Snorri. An ale spiced with Icelandic thyme.


And always, keep an eye out for seasonal beers. The breweries usually allow themselves more creative freedom on those products. In 2014, we saw beers like the Einstök Arctic Berry Ale (beer flavored with Icelandic berries), Fenrir (an IPA smoked with sheep dung) and Hvalur (the whale beer mentioned earlier).

General beer buying advisory

You won't buy Icelandic beers in the supermarket. The things that look like beers in those shelves are low-alcohol versions. To buy beers, you must go to one of the state-operated ""Wine stores"" (Vínbúð). Beware of their opening hours - they are never open after 20:00, on Sundays, or on holidays.

Comparatively, real ales I've tried have a bland, waxy taste to them, unlike craft beers such as Brewdog's Punk IPA, Dead Pony Club, and 5AM Saint.

A friend expressed to me his view that the terms “craft beer” and “real ale” are synonymous, stating: 


  “You realise that most of the industrialised breweries started out making “craft beer,” however demand and greed caused them to skimp on ingredients, adding less and less to make more and more profit? Most of these new breweries will probably go the same way.”


Whilst I agree in principle regarding greed and industrialisation, I am skeptical of the claim that most industrialised breweries started out making “craft beer.” Nor do I believe that “real ale” breweries have changed their recipes to that degree over time.

To put this into context, some beers I consider real ales are Youngs London Gold, Bombardier, Tribute, and Deuchars IPA, while some beers I consider craft beers are Brewdog IPA is Dead Citra, Kernel Black IPA, Lagunitas IPA, and Moor So’Hop.


What distinguishes a “craft beer” from a “real ale”?
Do “craft beers” change as breweries scale up for profits?
Did “real ales” use to taste nicer than it does today?

1052,2,,2014-10-17T14:30:48.050,9,,"First, a disclaimer:  I'm American and most of my knowledge of craft beer comes from the American beer scene.  I am somewhat aware of the evolution of the UK brewing industry, but nowhere near as knowledgeable as I am about America's.

Now, definitions.  Craft Beer commonly derives the Brewer's Association definition of a Craft Brewer.  Which is Small, Independent, Traditional.  Sparing the specifics it's a definition meant to exclude the world's largest brewing companies, and their ""crafty"" portfolios.  ""Crafty"" is a pejorative used to describe brands or brewers which may or may not produce good tasting beer, but are owned by the larger brands in attempts to diversify their portfolios.  While the BA is primarily focused on the American market, it seems most European writers defer to their terms.

Real Ale, is a distinctly British term.  Coined by CAMRA in the 70's it's more to do with the packaging and serving of the beer in the pub than the business scale of the brewer.  All Real Ale has to do is be cask conditioned and served via a gravity tap or hand-pulled with a beer engine.  This excludes a majority of what we in the US would consider craft beer, because it excludes anything kegged, filtered, force carbonated, or pushed with pressurized gas.

This leads to an interesting overlap where an unfiltered beer, carbonated by natural fermentation, could NOT be a real ale because it was kegged and served on gas.  Also, nothing prevents a large brand like Murphy's or Beamish (both owned by Heineken) from marketing a ""Real Ale"".

These definitions aside: It sounds like you may just be an IPA fan.  Your craft beer list is entirely IPAs.  It's not really accurate to conflate Craft and IPAs because plenty of craft beers are stouts, rye beers, Scotch ales, English bitters, or totally non-traditional things.

Another issue you might have with ""Real Ale"" is a technical note.  Because it's exposed to oxygen as soon as the cask is tapped real ale tends to spoil if it's not drank quickly.  The characteristic tastes of oxidized beer are cardboard, and the characteristic tastes of beer left on dead yeast for way too long is soapy.  I can easily see that coming off as ""waxy"", especially if it's warmer than you're used to drinking and you've just downed some IPAs.

Beer today is probably the best its ever tasted because of refinements in production techniques and farming.  Consumers are becoming interested in what their beer is made of so the quality of ingredients and care on a whole is improving.  But real ale is a niche,  there are going to be great traditional brewers making phenomenal beer, but it's prone to spoilage if not treated well.  There may also be those using it as a marketing gimmick.

And finally a last point about industrialization:  It has vastly improved the quality of ingredient and process that all brewers use.  The huge brands we now have, all started off as craft at one point.  But if they are no longer craft they either couldn't weather the market and faced the choice of no longer being a company or selling to a business and risk becoming more about business than beer.  In the US we have large breweries proving you can still be pretty big and make good beer.  Sam Adams, Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head, Yuengling, are HUGE by craft standards and haven't compromised the quality of their ingredients because brewers are still in charge.  Industrialization will never prevent a brewery lead by a passionate brewer from making interesting beer, but leaving brewing decisions up to a business man will always making boring beer.

The 3 day thing is a little more puzzling.  Wheat beers in general are a style that should be had as fresh as possible, but 3 days is definitely pushing it.  Most bars will try to finish a keg of a fresh wheat beer in 2 weeks or less, if memory serves.

From reading the Google automated translation of that PDF you're referencing, that sounds like a sales/marketing document.  The way I'm taking the information is that the document is selection criteria for starting accounts with Erdinger to sell the beer at your bar.  A lot of the document seems like quality control steps like making sure the draft system is setup correctly and properly balanced, making sure the lines get cleaned at appropriate intervals, and the 3 day thing for assuring max freshness.

From a consumer standpoint:  It'll last more than 3 days, you can take however long you want if it's on CO2, but for best flavor for a wheat beer you probably want to drink it within a month or 2...probably a bit longer if it's been refrigerated.

Likewise, there are craft brewers who use cask conditioning and even more so, bottle conditioning.

I would say that ""craft"" beer is a rather vague term. The best way that I could distinguish between ""craft"" brewers and other brewers is through the use of ""craft"" or trade. Those who produce beer as a trade would be craft brewers rather as opposed to industrial producers.

The classic Belgian beers all have their characteristic glass shapes, which are a part of the experience of the beer.  Duvel, Kwak, Mort Subite and the rest come in glasses of various shapes and sizes.

The traditional Stella Artois glass was a straight, narrow-ish glass, much like that of other basic lager-style beers like Jupiler or Maes Pils.  They usually have a set of ridges towards the bottom for improved grip and to reduce heat transfer.  The lager brand glasses are all very similar, reflecting their status as ""ordinary, everyday"" beers.  Only the expensive specialty beers have really distinctive glasses.

The glasses are usually small for Belgian lager (about 275ml), so the beer would still taste cold and fresh at the bottom.  Larger half-litres are sold, but older Belgians would always drink a small beer as larger beers go ""off"".

In my view the Chalice is pure marketing bullshit.  Taking an ordinary beer and dressing it up as something more expensive and more special than it is.  It makes me as angry as the UK positioning of the brand as French, when it is brewed in the very Flemish town of Leuven.

I know that 0% alcohol by weight (ABW) is also 0% alcohol by volume (ABV), and I know that 100% ABW is 100% ABV. I also know that, in between those two extremes, the relationship is not linear (e.g., 3.2% ABW is approximately 4.0% ABV). However, any web-site calculator that I see pretty much performs the calculation as linear.

I've been fiddling with my TI-89 from high school, and I think that I have it figured out. Assuming ethyl alcohol has a density of .789 kg/l and water has a density of 1 kg/l and assuming that water and alcohol are the only substances in an alcoholic beverage (which I know isn't true), the formula is:

ABV = ABW ÷ (.211 · ABW + .789)


The problem is that I can't confirm my formula. I'm searching Google and can't find much on the topic. Well… I can find plenty of calculators, but they all seem to be using a linear formula.

So… is this formula correct?



EDIT: So, I've done a little more tweaking on this (after I already got the accepted answer). I already made the assumption that the density of water is 1 kg/l. The density that I used for ethyl alcohol was for 20°C. At that same temperature, water has a density of approximately .99823 kg/l and not 1 kg/l. Using this, I arrived at a different formula that's probably more accurate (at 20°C, that is):

ABV = (99823 · ABW) ÷ (20923 · ABW + 78945)

1065,2,,2014-11-03T16:12:27.880,3,,"It is easier to reason about how to derive the alcohol-by-weight value from the alcohol-by-volume rather than the reverse.

If abv is the alcohol-by-volume value expressed as a number between 0 and 1, then for a unit volume of the liquid, the weight of the alcohol will be 0.789 * abv.  Similarly, the weight of the non-alcohol component will be 1 - abv (assuming it has a density of 1).  So the total weight of the liquid will be:

  0.789 * abv + (1 - abv)
= 1 - 0.211 * abv


Using the weight of alcohol and the total weight, we can easily determine the alcohol-by-weight (also expressed as a number between 0 and 1):

abw = 0.789 * abv / (1 - 0.211 * abv)


So this is clearly not linear (it is hyperbolic), and maintains identity for the 0% and 100% cases as expected.  We can invert the equation in a few steps:

                    0.789 * abv = abw * (1 - 0.211 * abv)
                    0.789 * abv = abw - 0.211 * abv * abw
0.789 * abv + 0.211 * abv * abw = abw
    (0.789 + 0.211 * abw) * abv = abw
                            abv = abw / (0.789 + 0.211 * abw)


So that confirms the formula you derived.  Wolfram Alpha seems to agree.

Just because some beers taste better cold, such as lagers compared to ales, doesn't mean they taste better when they are nearly frozen at +1C. Our perception of flavour diminishes as something is cooled, and so beer tastes less sweet and wines taste more acidic as they get colder.

Breweries know this and they spend significant dollars to invent a beverage that has the maximum taste profile for the least amount of ingredient spend. Bringing that product out of its intended temperature zone and into numbness makes a Coors or Bud have almost no character at all.

I can also imagine that bars are going to be reluctant to cool their pint glasses and spend a lot of money on electricity when it makes the beers taste little better than ordinary ice water. The end result is a disappointing ""freezie""-like experience that reduces the likelihood of someone ordering multiples of those over the course of an evening out, which is the ultimate benchmark for most bars.

If you drink four 12-ounce regular (5%) beers per day, you will add between 500-700 calories to your daily diet -- depending on the style of beer you consume, meaning its sugar content, which will vary with beer style. This calorie range translates into around 3500-5000 extra calories per week, which is equivalent to gaining about 1.0-1.4 lbs of weight per week if this calorie intake is above your body's minimum requirement (ie: 2100 x 7 days). 

After 3 months you will have gained anywhere from 13-18 lbs. It doesn't matter what you eat or don't eat along with your beer. If your beer drinking brings you over the 2100 calorie per-day threshold, those calories will show up as fat in your body. 

All of this assumes no exercise. If you are active and can burn off 300-500 calories a day through a combination of working out and regular body movement (general walking, going up and down stairs, prolonged upper-body activity), then you will cut into that calorie gain in proportion to your activity.

  Apart from some special circumstances, it is on the whole OK to drink while on antibiotics. The reason why people think that you should not is that when antibiotics was first being used it was to cure syphilis. The patients would still be infectious for the first week, so were told not to drink because they were more likely to have sex while drunk. This has since passed down and has become a ""tradition"" in a way. The main reason that people are told not to drink when on antibiotics is because doctors prefer people not to drink because it is better for them. However, the are some antibiotics like Flagyl which will make you vomit if you take them with alcohol.

In general it is known that some drugs should not be mixed with alcohol. Some of this knowledge are myths and some other are true.

As alcohol itself is a kind of anxiolytic it isn't clear if it really could cause
a side effect while on anxiliytics medication.

On the other hand, it seems that alcohol tends to make depressions worse.

If there are undesired side effects, is there a limit? 
is it safe to drink just a little or it is better to avoid it completely?

In the beer world, ""gluten free"" can only be used if the ingredients used to brew the beer do not contain gluten.  Sorghum appears to be the most popular ingredient for making GF beers, but there are a number of other options including buckwheat, millet, honey, even chestnuts.  Redbridge is an example of a GF beer.  IMO, sorghum gives off a cider-y flavor so I have not really enjoyed the sorghum-based beers.  Only gluten free beers that I've enjoyed are made by a Canada-based brewery called Glutenberg.  Their APA and IPA are fantastic.  Unfortunately, they don't currently distribute everywhere so I have to drive to a neighboring state to buy it.

There are also beers that are brewed with traditional ingredients that contain gluten, but an enzyme called Brewer's Clarex is added to primary fermentation.  Clarex was originally used to clear beer and prevent chill haze, but it was discovered it also breaks down gluten such that, when tested with traditional gluten tests (ELISA), the beer is well within the ""gluten free"" threshold (&lt;20 ppm).  These beers cannot be called ""gluten free"", though, rather they can only be labeled ""crafted to remove gluten"".  Omission brews ""gluten reduced"" beer (which are very good IMO), but apparently Yards also uses Clarex in some of their beers (even though they don't label their beer as ""crafted to reduce gluten"").

Antidepressants, on the other hand, certainly can have adverse effects when mixed with alcohol.  As far as drug interactions go, it will largely vary on the drug--without more information it is really impossible to say for sure what the answer is in your case.

However, on a more broad note, the use of alcohol is generally perceived as counterproductive while on antidepressants.  Alcohol can contribute to depression, so it is generally advised to be avoided while taking antidepressants.

Some people can drink 5 litres of beer and feel nothing. Many will feel dizzy and some will get near a coma.  Men tolerate alcohol better than women and some guys are very quick metabolizers, so they get alcohol out of their blood very quickly. The same reasoning aplies to drugs that act on the central nervous system. They have a sedating effect similar to alcohol and one may not feel one hundred percent alert while others may feel extremely sedated and unable to perform tasks that require attention and precision. For all this, there is always a warning about mixing alcohol with those drugs. However, effects vary a lot and you may get away with drinking and taking an SSRI such as Fluoxetine, Paroxetine or Sertraline. With a Benzodiazepine (Alprazolam, Clonazepam, Diazepam) you have to be more careful.

The flavor of other ""light lagers"" (european pilsners) may be similar, however, a pilsner is much easier to drink because, unlike most other light lager beers, a true pilsner is much less filling and has much less foam. Pilsner beers are noted for ""drinkability"". Beck's can be consumed with a large meal and then consumed afterwards as well. I believe this is why many non beer drinkers prefer and enjoy Beck's and almost no other beer. Click here for a list of ""German style pilsners"" as well as a list of the other types of similar beers and what makes them different Light lagers such as Heinekin, Stella, Amstel, etc ... are ""European pilsner"" beers typically labeled as lager whereas a German pilsner beer is typically labeled ""pilsner"" or ""pils"".

Heineken does produce a true pilsner variety but it is not officially distributed or available within the United States. Heineken lager is distributed and sold throughout North America and has much more body and is more filling as one would expect from a light lager or ""european pilsner"".

Sam Adams Gold pilsner is described as having ""great body"". This is not a characteristic of most German pilsners that are sharp and light bodied. This beeradvocate post goes on to say that ""This is one of those beers to give to a Bud drinker"" . . . definitely not something most people would say of Beck's. 

Similar beers include: 

Baltika #7 Export has a clean crisp light hoppy flavor and is less filling than Heinekin.

St Pauli Girl pilsner (not to be confused with St Pauli Girl lager) is brewed for export only at the Beck's brewery in Bremen Germany.

Tsingtao, a Chinese brewed German pilsner. Tsingtao is a product of the German occupation of Qingdao from the late 1800s until 1914. Not quite a flavorful as Beck's because the original recipe has changed but still a German pilsner in many aspects. Tsingtao is widely available at many Asian restaurants throughout North America and is a much better alternative or substitute for Beck's than Heinekin or Stella.

Löwenbräu produces Beck's under licence for southern Germany and other parts of europe and is known for similar flavor (but then again, so is Heineken).

Also, here is another list of German Pilsners.



Update:

If you're going to go the way of sam adams, at least get the right kind of beer and not some awful american lager. Sam Adams makes a Noble Pils.

Noble hops are the type of hops German pilsners are distinct for, strong hops flavor.

Even better is Sixpoint crisp. Strong hops flavor, easy to drink, and almost no hint of barley. More fruty than Beck's. 

Finally, Pilsner Urquell has a bit more foam than I would like from a German beer (probably because it's not German) but still did not weigh heavy on my stomach and easy to drink as well. Not quite as much flavor but I did not try the bottle. This one is a traditional pils.

EDIT:

I tried another German beer at the bar recently ""Weihenstephaner original"", brewed at the world's oldest brewery in Germany and brewed according to the German purity law of 1516. Sure enough, I didn't have to burp once. Drank a full pint glass and wasn't bloated one bit. 

Finally, the taste was the same familiar strong, pungent, and bitter hoppy taste I've grown so fond of from drinking German Beck's over the years and yes it comes in a very dark brown bottle. The bitterness is ranked at 21. They also make a pils with a bitterness of 32.

I feel it should be added that beer brewed in Germany often conforms to the Reinheitsgebot or the German purity law of 1516. This gives German beer the crisp fresh taste and this is also why the foam doesn't linger and make you feel bloated. In all other countries, including the united states, beer manufacturers are known to include many other ingredients. Notably, chemicals are added for ""head retention"" that are not included in German beer.

1119,2,,2014-12-05T20:05:55.367,1,,"Also bear in mind that beers back then were made out of lots of ingredients that we'd think of as odd.  Cock ale was obviously a thing, which was beer that was fermented (or boiled) with a rooster in it.  Lots of beers would also have been strained through spruce post-boil which would've given them some wood or pine quality.  Lots of other flowers were often involved.

Check out George Washington's small beer recipe here.  Though this is a poor transcription and a lot of folks agree that it should read ""Bran, Hops to taste"", it's still clear that the grain is sort of a ""for taste, whatever you can spare"" thing while the molasses is the star of the show.  A lot of early drinks were like that, involving some sort of concentrated or burnt sugar in addition to grains, which generally weren't barley at the time.

However, in the most ideal case where you had access to the best beer you could find...it would be some form of brown ale or lighter porter.  Maybe an amber ale if you could find one that wasn't very hoppy.  The stable kilning process that enabled people to make pale malt wasn't really invented until the mid-1600's and wasn't very popular until the 1700s, so brewers in the 1600s would've used a sort of generic-y brown malt that might taste slightly burnt and premium beers may have been able to include some lighter malt that was much harder to make and find.  And it'd probably still have some molasses in it.

1121,2,,2014-12-07T03:14:41.637,1,,"Beer was commonly drunk in the Elizabethan period in Europe, but what they drank is different from the beer we're used to today.

Beer and ale, being grain-based, were important dietary staples -- it's said that beer is liquid bread, and that's not far off.  For the common man (not nobility), in particular, grain made up a substantial part of the diet, with meat being fairly rare.

Common beer was not aged for months or years like some beers today; rather, a batch might be produced in as little as half a week.  These are ""small beers"" (or ""small ales"", for the unhopped variety), which are mildly alcoholic but drinkable in volume without unfortunate effects.  These small beers/ales were produced in the home/manor; it was just one more task for the cooks.  See, for example, Markham's The English Housewife, 1615. (I don't know of an online copy, sorry.)

Note that this means that the pilgrims wouldn't have brought beer from Europe; it'd be consumed, or probably go bad, before they reached the new world. So they probably didn't have beer in their first year because they'd need to wait for a grain harvest.  After that, if they brought hops with them then they could have made small beers like from the old country; if they didn't bring hops, they probably made ales instead.

Turkey would have been new to their palates (it's a new-world bird), but beer was commonly drunk with meals where they came from, and those meals sometimes included other fowl.  So, probably it pairs fine.  However, they probably didn't care as much about the proper pairing as we might today, the same as we might not care about pairing the proper cola with the turkey sandwich we have for lunch.

A few bugs on the grain isn't so bad (been there, brewed that) but mold is bad news, will actually screw up your beer (apparently some of the mold's enzymes will survive the boil and keep digesting your beer).

Dry yeast is supposed to be OK for 1 year at room temp, but it will stay viable for quite long time if sealed. That stuff is hard to kill completely.

As far as the extracts go, I've never heard of them going bad, as long as dry is dry and liquid is not diluted.

Our beer, we said, must also have the ability to &quot; clean up&quot; the palate, perhaps with a touch of citrus fruit or herbal, with a pleasant feeling of hops. But absolutely shouldn't be too sweet. So we'd prefer a product that is dry, bitter and strong with good carbonation, since bubbles help the drinkability.

Innis &amp; Gunn (original) is an obvious candidate. It's a very bland beer that's stored on American bourbon casks for a while. This gives it a strong, perfumy vanilla aroma. Some people think it feels artificial, but it's really not. It's the aroma of the American oak. Given that your friend loves vanilla it seems the obvious place to start.

Duchesse du Bourgogne is technically a Flemish red. It's a sweetish beer that's been stored in wooden barrels so that it turns a little acidic, too. Kind of fruity, kind of vinous, little bitterness. It's really a classic beer, and while many men love it (me among them), even more women seem to like it. Really worth trying.

German weissbier is sweetish, not sour, not at all bitter, and has a gentle banana flavour that comes from the yeast. Again it's something that many men like, and more women. Good examples are Weihenstephaner, Paulaner, and Erdinger (in that order). US wheat ale might work, too, but they generally use normal ale yeast and thus turn deathly boring.

Belgian witbier is similar to the weissbier, even though it uses a more neutral yeast, but then makes up for it with orange peel and coriander. Hoegaarden is the original, but there are many more examples you could try.

Belgian beer in general is sweet and low on bitterness. Some good ones to try: Westmalle Trippel, Barbar, Chimay White, La Trappe (legally Dutch), Rochefort, St Bernardus. All of these are fantastic beers that sound like they should appeal to your friend.

There's been big debates over to what degree they were aware that water caused diseases while beer did not, but a big factor was that beer was seen as nourishing (which it is) while water was not. In an age where getting enough to eat was a recurring challenge, this contributed to making people prefer beer/wine. In practice it seems people preferred alcoholic drinks for both reasons.

Generally, people would drink small beer as an everyday drink against thirst (and that's what children got, too), and beer proper for celebrations. That's actually a Finnish saying: ""small beer for work, beer for celebration"" (""Kaljalla työt tehdään, oluella pidot pidetään"").

Small beer was generally made together with beer. That is, they'd do a mash, and the first wort that's run off has the most sugar. As you keep pouring water through, obviously more and more sugar is washed out of the malts, and the wort keeps getting waterier. Eventually they'd stop, and make beer from the wort. Then they'd continue, and run off a much weaker wort from the remaining sugar in the malts. This was the small beer. Many places they would even do a third beer, which was so weak it would barely ferment. There were also other grain-based drinks, made from flour or bread, and typically sour and just barely alcoholic. Kvass is the best-known example, but there were many others.

Weak beer as an every-day drink continued for much longer than you might think. It was the introduction of tea/coffee that first started displacing it. Then, later, higher availability of milk, then juices and soft drinks continued the process. On Gotland, off the coast of Sweden, children were drinking weak beer as late as the 1960s. I lack data for exactly when this ended elsewhere, but it was long, long after the Middle Ages.

If you think the bottled beer tastes better there's a simple explanation that isn't exactly pretty. There's a good chance your bar is not cleaning its tap lines regularly enough. This messes with the taste and can add some funk.

Edit: It could also simply be due to the beers age. If a bar regularly rotates out kegs it could be much fresher, versus a store where a bottle might sit in storage for a few extra months. In the case of a bottle-conditioned beer the older bottle will taste better than a newer keg.

My advice would be to simply get a couple of friends, buy a bunch of 6-packs and share the beer and try different styles from whatever is available locally.

Beers like any of the light lagers should be fine for a year or two and not taste significantly worse provided they are stored properly.

Improper storage would be somewhere with warm or fluctuating temperature or where the beer is exposed to light. Light is what ""skunks"" beer, and can literally synthesize the same chemicals that makes skunks smell. 

The color of the bottle has a big effect on how rapidly this can occur. Clear glass provides no protection, I would not drink Corona that was left in the sun for even just one day (not that I wouldn't avoid it anyway). Green provides some, but is not much better (blocks somewhere around 40% of light). Brown is the best blocking around 90% of light, but completely opaque materials are the only things that are truly effective. Some breweries like Sam Adams even go the extra mile and have extra tall sides on their six packs to block light completely.

In short, old beer is not dangerous.
Some styles age well (belgian styles, german wheat, unfiltered styles).
Others do not (light lagers, pale ales, filtered beers).

It may not be the fact that it was exposed to higher temperatures that was the culprit, but the light. Warmer temperatures certainly seem like the most obvious offenders for a sub-par beer, but light is far more dangerous.

Temperature for the most part should not be an issue. Anything from like 32-75 F should not be an issue, although somewhere between 45-55 F is the ideal cellaring temperature. To break the upper limit of safe temperatures pretty much requires you to leave the beer outdoors during a hot summer where it will likely be joined by the bigger threat of light.

Long story short: cellaring temperatures are for long-term (12 months+) storage and anything between freezing and high-end room temperature shouldn't have any adverse effects if stored someplace dark. The idea that beer needs to remain ice-cold from the moment the yeast is added is a bunch of BMC marketing BS.

  UV light exposure causes negative effects (only a real problem for bottled beer).
  


UV light has a photochemical impact on hops. This causes it to have a flavor and aroma of a skunk. Brown bottles help lower the amount of UV light that can get to the beer, and with cans this is a non-issue.


  
  Extreme fluctuations in temperature are generally not good for the beer.
  


Extreme temperature fluctuations could impact the flavor of any drink, but most likely will be too subtle to notice. 


  
  Bottled beers can sometimes re-ferment at higher temperatures, causing over-carbonation.
  


Yeast needs sugars to ferment, by the time the bottle is on the shelves, the fermentable sugars are completely fermented and the yeast is in a dormant stage. However, this doesn't mean yeast cannot still affect the flavor of the beer. If the beer is bottle conditioned, then it still has live yeast cultures and extra care should be taken to keep it below high temperatures (80+ F.) for long periods of time. You should not be concerned of it exploding (over carbonating), that only happens in homebrews where they added too much sugars or didn't sanitize everything properly.

The majority of commercial beers are filtered to such a high degree that there is little to no live yeast to be concerned about. Some beers are even pasteurized to kill any remaining yeast, removing the possibility of it affecting flavor and extending its shelf life.



Bottom line is, avoid temperature fluctuations as much as you can, but its not something you should throw away perfectly good beer for. If you are a supertaster that can detect the subtle flavor changes, give it away to one of the 75% of us who are not.

Stone Brewmaster Mitch Steele decided to create it, a light colored beer which had the flavors of a stout,


  “To achieve the qualities of a stout, we relied on our prior experience brewing with coffee to pull flavors from the beans without affecting the hue of the beer,” explains Steele. “As the beer warms and opens up, the chocolate adds another level of complexity and helps build the traditional flavors typically associated with dark beers. It’s been really fun to see a prank with questionable viability become a reality.”


While this isn't the only example, it's one of the more notorious ones that serves well to explain the idea as well as how the flavoring is achieved.

It's quite popular to add flavors, especially spices, after
fermentation. The ideal method is to make extract of the spice, try
it in a sample of the finished beer, and add the right amount to get
the flavor level you want. Adding it during fermentation makes the
end result harder to predict (especially if the CO2 scrubs out
volatile flavor compounds) but it is not uncommon to dry hop while
the beer is near the end of fermentation.
The only special thing to do on brew day is make sure the beer style is suitable for the spice that you want.
For barleywine some people will continue to add fermentables over a long time, apparently it keeps the yeast happier.

  For 150 years or so after the word stout first began being applied to beer it was used simply as an adjective to mean “strong”.

CO2 absorbs more in colder conditions, but if anything freezes, even partially, CO2 gets driven out of solution.  Normally when you refrigerate kegs indoors they're hooked up to gas, so as pressure in the headspace drops it's less likely the keg will unseal itself.  Also, if the keg did freeze a bit the CO2 being forced into the headspace could conceivably go over the pressure limits of the keg, depending on how carbonated it was to begin with among other things.

Think of leaving a bottle or can in the freezer to chill it quickly then forgetting about it.  Odds are instead of a beersicle you got beer and glass sprayed all over the inside of your icebox.  It's anecdotal, I'll admit, but I've seen it happen so I wouldn't risk a keg and either leave it outside uncarbonated or chill it in a temperature controlled fridge.

Great examples: Hacker Pschorr, Hoegaarden, St. Bernardus

Dubbel - Dark, Belgian ales brewed with complex blends of malts resulting in deep, rich flavors and notes of dark fruits and spices despite lacking any of these ingredients.
Great Examples: Cordendonk Abbey Brown Ale, Chimay Red, Rochefort 8

German Wheat - Lots of styles within this, but these tend to be a bit heavier than witbier with more of a spicy character and less citrus. These range from the extremely light weissbier to dunkleweizens to the heaviest weizenbocks.
Great Examples: Weihenstephaner Weiss/Dunkel/Vitus, Schneider Weiss

Bock - Traditionally the heaviest of lagers, dark and complex but more mild than stouts. Little hop character with complex malts.
Great Examples - Weihenstephaner Korbinian, Ayinger Celebrator Dopplebock

Others I might try are a good Coffee Stout Narragansett, a caramel porter like the Sam Adams Holiday Porter, and if you're really striking out with all these Abita's Purple Haze is probably the best fruit-added beer out there aside from sours.

There are flavor additions you can throw in the kettle but you'll get the most bang for your buck with (SANITIZED!) additions during fermentation. Don't think twice about an amber ale, though; wait until you have some more experience before improvising with recipes.

Again, yes and no. In theory you can add more cane sugar, but in practice it only works with yeast that are highly alcohol tolerant. (Usually Belgian; highly alcohol tolerant yeast strains usually make no secret about their properties.) The yeast used for an amber ale is most likely not tolerant enough to go very far outside the recipe, and beer that is too alcoholic for the recipe generally tastes pretty bad.

I don't know how long it takes since I've never done it.

As to the process I was able to find this description at homebrewtalk.com:


  A 10 mL pipet is dipped into octanol and shaken so that most of the octanol is thrown off. 10 mL of chilled beer are drawn into the pipet and transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge tube. 1 mL of 3 N HCl is added followed by 20 mL of spectrographic grade iso-octane. The tube is shaken vigorously using a wrist action shaker (though I know one guy who does this determination professionally who shakes by hand) for 15 minutes. If there is a slush in the tube, centrifuge until the iso-octane phase is separate. Pipet a couple mL into a quartz 1 cm cuvet and read against another quartz cuvet filled with iso-octane and a ""minute"" amount of octanol. The IBUs are 50 times the absorbtion at 275 nm.


Best bet for your home brewing is to pick one of the estimation formulas and note it on all your beers, then you can rank them relatively based on your perception of the IBUs calculated and can better target the amount of bitterness you want in the future.  Since a lot of it depends on your equipment and the alpha acid content of the particular crop of hops.

  To really know the level of bitterness present in a beer, you must have a laboratory analysis performed. 


For home brewing purposes, the best you can usually do is to plug the alpha acid values of the hops you're going to use into an IBU calculator such as the one from Brewer's Friend or using Beersmith to calculate the bitterness. (The alpha acid values can be found on the hops' packaging.) 

It's worthwhile to not get too wrapped up in IBU. From Daniels:


  Using all these techniques … the big guys only control their bitterness to within plus or minus 2 IBU! Given that the average level of bitterness might be something like 15 IBUs, that represents an allowable variation of 13 percent in the bitterness of the product. The reason [major producers] don't sweat over the IBU inside that range is because the human palate can't detect the difference. Studies have shown that the detection threshold for bitterness is about 5 IBU. And that is for beers in the 10 to 15 IBU range. Among home and craft brewers, the sensitivity is usually less because we are used to more bitter beers.

3191,2,,2015-01-13T16:29:00.240,6,,"When one speaks of ""Belgian brewing"", one must distinguish between two major styles of beer: the famous abbey ales produced by Trappist orders in Belgium (and now one in America), and the the saisons and bières de garde produced as inexpensive nutritional supplements and dietary staples for farm life. An interest in the history and production of these beers is best served by Phil Markowski's Farmhouse Ales and Stan Hieronymus' Brew Like a Monk.

To touch on a few of your questions:


As previously alluded, beer served a utilitarian purpose as a dietary staple and nutritional supplement for an agrarian society. Beer was frequently brewed in large batches at regular intervals in support of farm life, and the result were table beers and saisons for work during the harvest and bières de garde (loosely translated: ""beers for keeping"") to survive the winters. 
Abbey ales are not as varied as they initially appear. Much of the variation in beers brewed in Trappist style come from fermenting different ""runnings"" of the same batches of wort (unfermented beer); to summarize very briefly, the strength is dependent upon the sugar content which is dependent on how many times the mashed malt has been ""rinsed"". See Wikipedia's page on lautering for more details.
Belgian and English brewing are actually not very dissimilar from a historical perspective, and there was quite a bit of overlap in technique between English, Belgian, and Flandrian brewers. The differences in style we perceive now (e.g. IPAs vs Flemish sours) evolved by regional taste preferences from common roots: malt-forward beers (which were originally quite sour) using the low alpha acid noble hops which thrived on the continent. Consider the similarities in taste and composition between an ESB and a dubbel.


In addition to the above referenced works, a quick read through the history section of Jeff Sparrow's Wild Brews should answer any remaining questions you might have about the history of Franco-Belgian beer.

Because the primary purpose of conditioning is to carbonate the beer, the method (bottle vs keg) used to do so is a matter of personal preference or production constraints. At this point in the production cycle, the yeast have done all they're going to do with the wort (technically referred to as a yeast's ""attenuation"") and you're left with two options that yield virtually identical results: bottle the beer with some added sugar to motivate the remaining yeast to create more CO2, or force-carbonate the beer in a keg.

The Trappists are an official Catholic religious order that follow the rules of St. Benedict, one of which states ""for then are they monks in truth, if they live by the work of their hands"".  The monasteries all make goods, most commonly beer and cheese, that they sell in order to fund themselves.  Several of the monasteries form the International Trappist Association in order to prevent anyone who's not actually a part of the order from using the name Trappist on their products.  

But Trappist ale isn't really a style, it's a commercial seal like ""Organic"".  Both Dubbel and Tripel originated as names of specific beers brewed by Trappists at the Westmalle abbey.  Dubbel coming to use in the 1850s and Tripel (1950s) being a renamed and slightly hoppier version of what the monks used to call Superbier (1930s).  Quadrupel is a brand of La Trappe made at the Koningshoeven abbey, which was probably introduced some time in the 1990's. Koningshoeven Also used to market a beer named Enkel, but stopped production in 2000.

In all cases the popularity of the beers led to imitation by other brewers which sort of turned their brand names into loose stylistic designations.  It'd be like if people started imitating Stone's Arrogant Bastard and started producing their own Arrogant ale.

3209,2,,2015-01-20T15:34:34.440,1,,"While, as object88 says, it is uncommon for draught beers to use nitrogen, it is becoming more prevalent, though certainly not dwarfing CO2 draught beers anytime soon! So, it is certainly possible to remain consistent from bottle to draught, though it is less common and more costly to do so.

Both bottled and draught beers use nitrogen to add bubbles instead of CO2 on occasion. This is more common with malty beers, say stouts and porters, than it is for hoppy beers. The nitrogen makes smaller bubbles than CO2, and creates a thick head due to the lower solubility of nitrogen in water than CO2 at the same temperatures. This creates the thicker mouthfeel that Guinness (as well as other nitrogenated stouts) are known for. 

CO2 will likely continue to be used for most hop-forward beers, since it pushes more aroma out of the beer (including the delicious hop scent!) while nitro is more about the mouthfeel and well-rounded flavor.

A few reasons why other beers don't use the small nitrogen ball devices (""nitrogen widgets""):


  Alcohol laws (or FDA or something?) doesn’t allow craft brewers to add
  widgets/foreign objects to alcohol (cans). Imports exempt?
  
  Not cost effective for small brewers, who are only just able to start
  affording canning systems.

It'd be hard to notice anything.  Hoppy beers might have their big aromas fade a bit or get a less smooth bitterness.  Anecdotally, some of the smoother DIPA style beers with big floral or citrus hop smells/tastes might degrade into more biting bitter territory.

Big beers made for aging will generally be forgiving but heating and cooling them a lot might make them taste flatter or cardboardy.  But again, we're talking several upon several times before anything noticeable happens.

Long story short...it's probably not going to do anything you're going to notice chilling unopened beers back down from room temperature.

  Aroma: Low to moderate malt aroma, generally caramel-like but
  occasionally toasty or toffee-like in nature. May have a light buttery
  character (although this is not required). Hop aroma is low to none
  (usually not present). Quite clean.
  
  Appearance: Amber to deep reddish copper color (most examples have a
  deep reddish hue). Clear. Low off-white to tan colored head.
  
  Flavor: Moderate caramel malt flavor and sweetness, occasionally with
  a buttered toast or toffee-like quality. Finishes with a light taste
  of roasted grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish.
  Generally no flavor hops, although some examples may have a light
  English hop flavor. Medium-low hop bitterness, although light use of
  roasted grains may increase the perception of bitterness to the medium
  range. Medium-dry to dry finish. Clean and smooth (lager versions can
  be very smooth). No esters.
  
  Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although examples containing
  low levels of diacetyl may have a slightly slick mouthfeel. Moderate
  carbonation. Smooth. Moderately attenuated (more so than Scottish
  ales). May have a slight alcohol warmth in stronger versions.
  
  Overall Impression: An easy-drinking pint. Malt-focused with an
  initial sweetness and a roasted dryness in the finish.
  
  Comments: Sometimes brewed as a lager (if so, generally will not
  exhibit a diacetyl character). When served too cold, the roasted
  character and bitterness may seem more elevated.


The criteria also has some examples of beers that you would like if you like this:


  Three Floyds Brian Boru Old Irish Ale, Great Lakes Conway’s Irish Ale (a bit strong at 6.5%), Kilkenny Irish Beer, O’Hara’s Irish Red Ale, Smithwick’s Irish Ale, Beamish Red Ale, Caffrey’s Irish Ale, Goose Island Kilgubbin Red Ale, Murphy’s Irish Red (lager), Boulevard Irish Ale, Harpoon Hibernian Ale

3290,2,,2015-03-12T20:42:00.650,6,,"The red color usually comes from certain kinds of caramel malt, which comes in a range of colors but is usually used to make a sweeter, fuller-bodied beer than everyday pale ales and lagers. In this way, they're very similar to amber ale/lagers, and the difference can be very subtle and is very subjective. If you like one, you'll 99% of the time enjoy the other. Most of what you mentioned- like Dos Equis and Yuengling- are marketed as ambers.
That said, I looked up Honest Lager, and Walkerville markets it as Märzen (sometimes but not always the same as Oktoberfest) It's less hoppy and more full-bodied than a Pils or other pale lager, and tends to be reddish or amber in color. If you look a the German/import section of your local beer store or supermarket, you should be able to find an example of something similar, just look for the words &quot;Märzen,&quot; &quot;Oktoberfest,&quot; &quot;Festbier,&quot; etc. A Munich-style Dunkel would also probably be right up your alley.
Key words I would use: sweetish, medium-bodied, balanced, caramelly, toasty. But just think about different foods and aromas while you're drinking, and see what your impression is. Everybody's different.
If you do want to use the BJCP guide, just remember that they're designed for judging homebrew competitions, and professional brewers don't have much reason to pay attention to them. So if you pick up a beer and it doesn't match up with its BJCP style, it's not a catastrophe, and the beer is still perfectly good!

3291,2,,2015-03-14T23:05:56.133,3,,"As soon as I read ""Red Lager"" I thought to myself, this guy is probably looking for Vienna Lagers (aka Amber Lagers. For whatever reason beer marketers greatly prefer the term ""amber"" over ""red"" when referring to lagers, while using ""red"" over ""amber"" when referring to ales eg Red IPA). These are lagers with a slightly sweeter profile than the ""standard International pilsner"" style churned out by every macrobrewery, due to the addition of Vienna, crystal, and/or caramel malts. Indeed, when looking at the  examples you gave on Rate Beer and Beer Advocate, RB considers both to be of the ""Amber Lager/Vienna"" style, while BA considers Dos Equis to be a Vienna Lager and Yuengling to be an ""American Amber/Red Lager"". What's the difference? Generally, the ""American"" prefix at the start of any beer style means that it's hoppier, due to our lovefest with hops (at least compared to the Old World). Also, RB doesn't break amber lagers into American and not varieties.

You can use the category page on Ratebeer or Beer Advocate to browse through more examples of the style. Ratebeer's list is default sorted by rating, which isn't always helpful if you don't live somewhere with a great selection, but you can click on ""Count"" and it will sort by number of ratings; Beer Advocate's is default sorted by number of reviews. 

The two beers you mention are very widely available: On RB, Yuengling is #2 most reviewed and Dos Equis is #7; for rating though neither cracks the top 50. On BA, Dos Equis is the #3 Vienna Lager by reviews and #38 by rating, while Yuengling is the #1 American Amber/Red Lager by reviews and #21 by rating. For some great examples of Vienna/Amber Lagers you might be able to find, Sam Adams Boston Lager is rated #44 on RB and #3 on Beer Advocate (why the big discrepancy? RB users tend to be more heavily biased by the idea that certain breweries aren't ""cool"", while BA users tend to be more objective).

There is always the BJCP guide, which makes the rules that guide most homebrewing and professional contests such as the GABF. The GABF can have real reputation and financial influence for a brewery, so it requires very precise definitions, but outside of competitions most of the brewing world takes the BJCP with a grain of salt (or is it a grain of barley?). Personally, I prefer the Ratebeer and Beer Advocate's style categorizations. Not that they are perfect either - part of the beauty of craft beer is that it is ever-evolving, and brewer creativity knows no category bounds - but it is more democratic and reflective of actual market tastes.

If you are willing to go a little further afield, you might try a Scottish Ales, like Founders Dirty Bastard (www.ratebeer.com/beer/founders-dirty-bastard-scotch-ale/11498/); a Red IPA (not an official style) such as Troegs Nugget Nectar (www.ratebeer.com/beer/troegs-nugget-nectar-ale/30812/); or even a Bière de Garde, France's only indigenous beer style (these are harder to find, but I bet they have them in Montreal. try www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/biere-de-garde/58/ or www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/127/.

If your interest is just to not get completely obliterated after drinking several beers, I'd investigate a category called ""Session"" beers, which are regular beers brewed without artificially removing any alcohol but are designed to be flavorful at 3-4% ABV rather than the common 5-6%+ that many craft beers tend to be.  Full Sail session lager, Stone's Go To IPA, and Founder's All Day IPA should be pretty easy to find, but investigate more local and regional breweries to see if they make any.

3297,2,,2015-03-17T13:52:42.823,6,,"What it really sounds like you're getting at is that the beer you drink at a brewery is better than the beer you buy off the shelf at a store.  I'd believe that.  Beer from a brewery's tap is likely incredibly fresh, which most people would agree for most styles is better.  Especially with how popular hoppy beers are in the San Diego scene, hops fade quickly...fresher will be way more aromatic.  The beer you buy in the store may have been filtered or pasteurized, has been bottled and then sat in a warehouse for a while before being trucked around the county and then sitting on a shelf for a while before you hauled it back home.  

However, is there an objective way to express ""Fresher is better""?  Dunno, probably not.  You could run lab analysis and try to point at alpha and beta acid numbers, volatile organic oils or something...but it almost seems like trying to cobble together a theory after having made the conclusions already.

The BJCP was mentioned in another answer.  What BJCP is, is an attempt to apply objective qualitative judgment to taste, which is inherently subjective, by asking folks to compare what they're sensing to an ideal example.  Basically ""How closely does this beer I'm tasting now adhere to description of the style of beer it's supposed to be?""  They'll generally look at 


Head: color, density, how long it lasts. 
Aroma: malty? hoppy? spicy? grassy? sulphury? 
Visual: color, clarity 
Feel: thickness on the tongue, fizziness, acidity...
Taste: malty, hoppy, spicy... balanced?


What you COULD theoretically do is drink the beer at the brewery, and then describe as if it was a BJCP description, then drink the beer from the store and grade it according to how close it resembles the brewery beer in those categories.



Outside of that, everything is subjective.  What you feel like drinking, right now.  The beer best suited to the weather will change with each season, beers best suited to the evening will change with what you're having for dinner.  Hell, if you happen to be playing Skyrim maybe the beer with the dragon on the label will be better than anything else regardless what it tastes like.

3313,2,,2015-03-26T07:27:42.003,4,,"Sorry for the late response, but as I look on the internet for discussions concerning this topic I ran across this question.

In the mid 1800's in England, IPA's were created and produced for multiple reasons. Long story short, as Europe was going through a technology renaissance period, ingredients used for brewing changed and grains that were converted into malt became lighter. Therefore, dramatically changing the ""beer"", that was much darker at that time, now into and ale. As this changed the palettes of many at that time they also introduced a great amount of fresh hops to these new ales to make a strongly hopped ale. The term IPA was introduced as a well known brewer(s) started shipping this new type of beer to India, giving it the distinct name IPA-India Pale Ale.

I am providing this back ground to make a point. As this product was fermented, it was very typical to age and IPA Beer for a minimum of 1 year. This was done to assure that the beer was completely fermented and safe to transport on ships to India. This trip would take even more time and put the produced under various environmental stresses. This beer or ""ale"", was hopped very strongly and even topping the very hoppiest beer on the market in the U.S. today. Using the freshest malt as well as the freshest hops.

My final point or argument is, that as I recreate the IPA and use fresh ingredients typical to a real IPA, I find that my IPA's last over a year in the bottle. As I drink them 3 to 6 and even 9 and 12 months the hoppy flavors still remain and even develop. 

There are many variables that allow me to get to this end result. This including yeast and malt selection, and also multiple methods that help produce beneficial fermentation, allowing the taste of the final product to be clear of flaws that would be created by the yeast during primary as well as the bottling (carbonation) period.

After 30 years of beer making many of these truths become evident as I continually taste the final product, take very good notes and adjust my recipe.

Finally, I can say that with the correct procedure of beer making, an IPA can be enjoyed at various stages from 1 week and even up to one year and can still be enjoyed for its distinct hop flavor and aroma.

That modified filter also required significantly more CO2 to maintain pressure, I don't think that was true of the purpose built devices.

It goes without saying that if a beer has two or more of these characteristics the odds of it improving with cellaring go up. But even if it has all three characteristics it may not improve with age, or only aging to a certain point.

Plus you must remember that proper aging is also required. Proper storage, temperature control, how the bottle is positioned while being stored, etc.

Well researched and void of conjectural inaccuracy. If hops were the only flavor in IPA then yes it could be decreasingly ""hoppy"" but that's assuming we're referring to the aroma hops. Your bittering hops would surely deepen with time. But with any beer there are more layers than one. High ABV beers will just broaden the chord change more as every flavor will carry different in the changing alcohol/water/sugar levels that time provides. Fruit in the beer no matter its place on the sweet/sour spectrum (notably normally high point as well) have similar success on the ""cool dark"" shelf. This is due to natural fermentation of organic matter  stored over time. Ever noticed how fresh salsa gets effervescent in your fridge? Granted there are no chunks of fruit (or tomatoes luckily) in your beer so the effects are severely lessened. They weigh in on the scale equal to the alcohol changes mentioned above.

In response to a previous answer, color has nothing to do with ale v. lager, nor alcohol concentration (Guinness is an ale and 4.2% where Aventinus Eisbock is a lager and 12%), it only tells you how it was fermented.

According to Wikipedia, lagering became more commercially viable with the appearance of refrigeration systems. But White &amp; Zainasheff describe why this was desired. After Pasteur showed that yeast are responsible for fermentation, the Carlsberg brewery isolated S. carlsbergensis, now known as S. pastorianus, for commercial use. This is a lager yeast, and since many ales were brewed with mixed (S cerevisiae plus wild yeasts, bacteria) cultures, it created the perception was that lager, as a style, was cleaner than ale, and the improved shelf life made it a more attractive product to produce. And so, lagers took over the beer world after that, despite so many small breweries that make high quality ales.

If you really screw things up, (forget to add yeast, drop  dead mouse in there) maybe its possible to grow some listeria or something, but you'd probably find the smell to be intolerable.

Typical beer infections will produce various levels bad flavors along with some scum on top of the bottled beer (since yeast produce bubbles and foam when working, this scum might not be visible until the yeast are completely finished, usually after the beer has been bottled).

there are many more styles &amp; different kind of yeast to choose from
if you make ale.
Most ales can be produced faster than lagers, which is helpful when

Ales are easier to make at home, so home brewers are quite familiar

chill your beer to 35°F - 40°F and pour about 2/3 of it into the proper glass for that beer. 
Drink at least 4 or 5 sips, gulps, or however you typically consume it.

It makes a big difference on some beers. less on others. Also try different types of glasses and see what you like.

Porter is a really similar style that takes well to interesting spice combinations like vanilla and anise.  Bourbon Barrel aged stouts will have a wood/vanilla/whiskey thing going on.  You could make some interesting cakes.

In the Massachusetts area Pretty Things Beer &amp; Ale Project does a series of 1800s English ales called Once Upon a Time.  Beer historian Ron Pattinson helps them design all those recipes based on his research, so they should be fairly accurate.  Dogfish Head has a similar series called Ancient Ales which are best-guess recreations of VERY ancient middle eastern and asian beers based on archeological evidence...studying the chemical residue left on beer containers.

You might be able to find some recreations by Brouwerij de Molen who also tapped Ron Pattinson to consult.

Traditional Belgian styles are unlikely to have changed significantly, so those are an option.  The smaller niche styles don't evolve as quickly, though the methods will be updated so they won't be as accurate as deliberate recreations.  Saison Dupont was mentioned.  Fantome springs to mind as well.  Certain sour beers like Faro or Gueuze Lambics should be close, but avoid the fruity ones.  Gose and Berlinerweisse might fit as well.  A lot of those European sour brewers have been doing things basically the same way for like 500 years.

If you can find anyone brewing a Sahti that would be an interesting adventure.  I've also heard rumor of a few recreations of styles like Gratzer/Grodziskie, I think New Belgium might make one...

On the smaller scale, if you're really interested see if you can find Frank Clark or Bob Grossman at a conference you might be able to get them to let you try a historic recreation beer, they generally work in the 1600s-1700s.  Frank Clark works as a food historian at Colonial Williamsburg so he should be easy to track down.  But I warn you, you probably don't want to actually drink the majority of that stuff.  Brewing was very different back in the day and a lot of their beers are pretty foul to modern tastes.  Differently prepared sugars and odd herbs and spices.  Stuff like boiling molasses until it literally lights on fire then fermenting it...kilning grains until some of the kernels straight explode and burn.  And let's not even get into stuff like cock ale, which had a parboiled rooster added during secondary fermentation.

3389,2,,2015-05-28T13:42:57.833,8,,"""Trappist"" isn't so much a style as it is a commercial label.  Something like ""Organic"" or ""Kosher"" that comes with a set of regulated conditions that product was produced under.

Per wikipedia, to be able to be labelled a Trappist beer:


The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.
The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life
The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture. The income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance of the buildings and grounds. Whatever remains is donated to charity for social work and to help persons in need.
Trappist breweries are constantly monitored to assure the irreproachable quality of their beers.


A lot of those monasteries also make lighter or hoppy beers.  Engelszell even uses honey in their beers, so there's a pretty significant variety when it comes to what you can call ""Trappist"".

But if we're talking the classic dark Belgian-y abbey ale.  According to the Beer Advocate ratings, the top Trappist-produced beers are:


Westvleteren 12
Rochefort 10
Chimay Cinq Cents
Achel Extra Blond
Rochefort 8


Through user rankings.  The Brothers that run the site give Rochefort 8 a higher rank than 10, which I agree with, and give both Rochefort's a higher rating than Westy 12.

So I guess the answer is that somewhere between Westvleteren 12, the Rochefort 8 and 10, and Chimay is the best Trappist beer.  But even in the top 5 here there's some variation since Chimay and Achel are blondes, and Rochefort 8 is a fair lower ABV than the other 3.

With the styles being so wide, the real answer is probably whichever one you like drinking the most.

Though really, Rochefort 8 forever.

3392,2,,2015-05-29T16:41:26.840,8,,"The likely answer is somewhere between carbonation pressure and marketing.

It's hard to find numbers for how much caps can handle vs corks but you should notice that most corked beers also come in bottles with very thick glass, this is because the beer inside is at a higher pressure than most other styles.  

Most beer styles will fall pretty close to 2.0 or 2.5 volumes of CO2 (just the term, think of the number as a relative baseline), but a lot of Belgian strong beers like Bierre de Garde or Tripel will be carbonated with 3.3+ volumes.  Lambics and other sour beers can go up to 4.5 volumes.  This is a linear scale so that becomes possibly twice as much pressure as a normal bottle...so yeah, thicker glass.

At such high pressure you might find corks will stay put more reliably than a cap since it has more surface area in contact with the bottle.  It also might provide a more airtight seal than a cap for long-term aging.

Those would be technical considerations.

Corking also predated capping so there's also a very traditional feel about a bottle with a cork and a cage, which can fit into the traditional image a lot of breweries market themselves using.  I say I'm not sure and it could just be marketing because a lot of Wheat styles like German Wheats, Belgian Wits, etc are fairly highly carbonated (near the 3.3 volumes range) but most of them have no problems being capped.

As to the affect on taste?  Nada, apart from hypothetical aging concerns...unless mistreated you should not taste the cork.

You can use your fridge.  For comparison you can fill a glass with the same volume of liquid and set it next to the bottle, leaving a thermometer in it.  As long as they start off near the same temperature, that'll give you a pretty close approximation of the current temperature of the beer.  It might be easier to chill to the fridge temperature then let them warm back up.  It's not going to damage the beer and most fridges are close to the bottom end of ""cellar"" anyway so it won't take too long to warm up to where you want it.  Evaporation and glass thickness are going to create a difference, but given the range of temperatures, it should be close enough.

Obviously just hitting the numbers isn't going to make the correct beer, but these are quantitative numeric measures of variation over a style.

These dimensions are:


Original/Final Gravity (Sugar in the beer before and after fermentation)
SRM (Measure of Color)
ABV
IBU (International Bitterness Units)


These don't describe a ton about the actual flavor of the beer, just things like color, strength, body/sweetness, bitterness.  Note that while the ABV is tied to the difference between gravities, final gravity is and independent measure of the ""dryness"" of the beer.  Color and Bitterness are also totally independent of the others so you can have beers at the light color and bitter end but sweet, or dry and dark.

You can also check the BJCP guides which are for competitions to see what the ""ideal"" qualities of a given style are and then numerically grade a beer based on how well it meets those descriptions.  But they do describe what's allowed as variance for being considered ""on style"".

Of course plenty of brewers just don't care about that sort of thing and make beers how they like.

It's obviously opinion at this point but I think there's value in trying many different beers even though they may be in a style you've had a ton of before.  Each beer is different and those subtle differences may be the differences that really make you like one beer over another.  Maybe not a ton of the same thing in the same session...

It is also incorrect that a cork is necessary for higher carbonated beers. Many of the styles identified at higher carbonation volumes also come in capped bottles (particularly 375ml bottles). 

Corks do provide a better seal that slows the flow of air into the beer so those bottles will age more slowly than bottles with caps. That is the primary technical difference between the two.

The primary reasons for corking beer today is marketing. In some areas where corked bottles were traditionally used for bottling it was easier to get champagne bottles or similar bottles that could support carbonation and corking became a matter of convenience as it was cheaper to source bottles locally. However, now it is just a matter of marketing the product. All other corked bottles went into large format, corked bottles to make them look like a classier product than a six pack and legitimize higher prices in the customers' eyes. That is true for the beers you find on the market today in almost all cases. Very few beers go into corked bottles because the brewer truly believes it is necessary for the long term quality of the beer in a way that a cap or a cap plus wax would not provide.

Historically, most beer was served at cellar temperature to room temperature, depending upon what was available. That isn't just an English tradition. Any beer can be consumed warm and drinking it ice cold as mass produced lagers are usually served tends to hide most of the flavor that you are paying for in a good beer. Give it a try and see what you like. Maybe you don't like your beer a little warmer. Enjoy what you like.

3410,2,,2015-06-10T19:33:35.797,7,,"Just wanted to add to some of the already great answers… 

Although it has been mentioned what the characteristics of Nitro are, and why that might be good for the beer drinking experience, it hasn't really been said why to use it or rather why its used in lieu of CO2. 

History

It was mentioned that the historical carbonation process was very different, but nobody has connected the two, so I figure I'll add a little input to hopefully color in a bit more. A lot of the reason for carbonation is to preserve the beer. By replacing the oxygen in the keg the beer will last longer. Now we associate the carbonation with beer but that was not always there traditionally. While it is true that older beer bottled from barrel storage was carbonated during bottling it wasn't mentioned that historically beer was poured from the cask and therefore not carbonated beyond natural carbonation. 

Cask

In this string cask beer wasn't mentioned but it is literally from the barrel. It is the smoothest and creamiest way to ""tap"" beer. It's also considered the best by many purists. It however has a huge limitation in modern applications. The barrels don't last as long and thereby need to be smaller, swapped out more often, and potentially wasted if not used quick enough. For this reason most businesses opt for the larger, easier, cheaper carbonated kegs. 

Purists

As stated before by Jeffrey Lin the Nitro is a newer solution but I have to take exception to his explanation of the unnatural side of Nitro. Really the purists are fine with nitro. They may not be particularly fond of the ""in-can"" nitro widget, but really the process just replaces a larger CO2 bubble with the smaller finer bubbles of dissolved nitrogen and thereby some dissolved C02 as well. Purists truly would be more likely to enjoy a cask pour but as Nitro, in a lot of ways, is closer to cask both in consistency and the ""creaminess"" described it goes without saying this would be enjoyed by the purists as well. 

Types of Beer for Nitro

There are many types of beer where smooth finer bubbles are appropriate. Guinness being only one that comes to mind but really most British milds. Also English ales, pales and creams just to mention a few. The older styles from England were flat compared to American lagers and most modern beers. Another good example is a Boddingtons. Finer bubbles fit the mold with anything that traditionally would be served from the cask. 

Technology

As with most new technology it serves a purpose and in this case the purpose is two-fold. Store without oxygen to prevent going bad, and keep with the original intended style of those types of beers. The discussion of flavor change is slightly off because flavor change would only be present if oxygen were allowed to be present in the beer when kegged. Texture change is more accurate and the nitro is an effort to more closely approximate that. 

Conclusion

Hope that is helpful to fill in some details and thanks to Sloloem for helping, hopefully it is more easily digestable/readable? It may not be science but historically speaking it might be philosophy…

  Beer head (also head) is the frothy foam on top of beer which is produced by bubbles of gas, typically carbon dioxide, rising to the surface. The elements that produce the head are wort protein, yeast and hop residue. The carbon dioxide that forms the bubbles in the head is produced during fermentation.

3415,2,,2015-06-23T14:09:47.053,5,,"There are some good answers here, but to distill and maybe enhance:

Beer heads are a great indication of proper serving because if any number of factors that could affect the taste are off, they'll also affect the head.  Some of these are:


Warm beer foams too much. If your server is dumping tons of head down the drain to fill your glass with enough beer, it might be too warm.
Too much pressure in the keg makes beer foam too much.  The brewer carbonated it to the level they wanted, the bar might be over-carbonating it.
Cold beer does not foam very much.  If the kegs are chilled too cold or the bar is serving beer in a frozen glass, your beer is probably too cold.  Cold temperatures will dull flavors and kill aromas. Obviously if you're into beer for flavor, this is bad.
Dirty glasses tend to dissipate the foam very quickly, so you could be drinking whatever was in the glass before, or soap scum... neither of which sounds very tasty.
Under-carbonated beer doesn't foam very much.  Under-carbonation can also dull flavors since so much of taste is based on smell and you can't smell volatile aromatics if there's no fizz to carry them out of the liquid.


There are various schools of thought on the head as an indicator of beer's quality or freshness but realistically this will vary by style.  Think of the thick creamy head of Guinness stout; remove the head and you completely change the experience.  The large luxurious heads of Belgian beers, or the thinner off-color head of porters.

Also, without a good head with lots of tiny popping bubbles of CO2 to spray the air above the glass with volatile aromatic oils, you wouldn't have nearly as much hoppiness to smell and taste in an IPA or spices from a Belgian style.

The etching is called a nucleation point (or a widget in the UK) and helps the release of carbonation and can create a steady stream of bubble emanating from the etched portion of the glass. This works by CO2 releasing (dissolving into gas) when it comes in contact with the rough surface of the nucleation points.  This is not a mere marketing ploy and a nucleation point does increase the amount of bubbles released when compared side by side with a non- nucleated beer glass.

3461,2,,2015-07-13T20:39:08.277,3,,"The short answer is no.  While they're both styles of dark beer nowadays Mild is very low ABV with a lot of malty/nutty flavors and fruity sweetness.  Stouts are stronger than milds with no fruitiness and a lot of roasted and burnt flavors instead of malts.  Most will probably be more bitter and have less residual sweetness than milds.



The long answer is:

Historically stout and mild were completely unrelated terms that referred to completely different things than they wound up being known for.  Both started being used in the 18th century.  Stout originally just meant strong and Mild was used as the opposite of Keeping (or Stale), which basically just meant the beer was fresh rather than being aged in a barrel for any length of time.

Mild turned into a strength descriptor in the early 19th century when brewers started using the X, XX, XXX system to classify their ales, which referred to both the ABV and pounds of hops per barrel.  But Mild was still a pale beer.  As the 20th century progressed Milds started becoming more amber colored and playing more as malty and sweet.

All beers until this point were actually much stronger than we're used to today.  Barclay Perkins X Ale in 1839 was actually close to 8% ABV.

Grain shortages and government restrictions towards the end of WWI dropped Mild to close to 2%, and brewers also added dark sugars and mixed in amber and brown malt to keep some measure of flavor.  After the war ended ABVs bounced back up but new taxes in the 30s pushed them back down, close to the modern range for Mild.  Dark mild being the standard and Pale mild being a variant didn't really happen until the 1950s.

The history of stout is quite a bit muddier, though the general consensus seems to be that it evolved out of Stout Brown Porter and has been largely interchangeable with Porter for most of its history.  

The differentiation probably started with in the invention of Black Patent Malt in 1817.  In the late 1700s new technology had been invented that allowed brewers to track their efficiency and they realized the roasty brown malt they used for porters was really expensive compared to how much fermentable sugar it produced. So they started making porters out of mostly pale malt with brown malt and burnt sugars among other ingredients for color and flavor.  

Britain had banned the use of anything besides malted barley in brewing in 1816 which really kindof screwed porter brewers over.  With Black Patent they had something which was absurdly dark enough that they could finally make up the color difference using pale malt.  Though most brewers in England continued to use some portion of brown malt, brewers in Ireland switched completely to pale and black malts only.  Irish beer was also less hoppy than English beer in general since hops didn't grow as well in Ireland.

Guinness renamed its XX Porter to Extra Stout Porter in ~1820 and the popularity and marketing gradually dropped ""Porter"" from the name, which is probably where Stout began to evolve as a style separate from Porter.  But it's in a bit of grey area, people in 2015 are still debating Porter vs Stout.

Short version of the long story

Mild originally just meant Fresh and as a style evolved from the weakest pale beer a brewery made, and only really became what we think of it as today in the last 60 years.  Stout originally just meant Strong and was a synonym for Porter for a very long time until marketing tried to differentiate it maybe 150 years ago.

Anyway, you won't be disappointed with beers available and bar options - Pinheiros region being the place where you'll find the best ones.
Keep an eye open for Jupiter, Urbana, STP, which are gypsy breweries born in the city, and have a lot of modern styles (Black IPAs, American Wheat, Brown IPAs, APAs, etc). Urbana has a very good Belgian Strong Golden Ale called Gordelícia, by the way.
Bamberg is a brewery dedicated to german styles, with some state-of-art german style reproductions with tons of international awards. Colorado is one of the oldest breweries in the country and, although it doesn't have a wide portfolio, its beers are easy to find at supermarkets, affordable and still very good. They have a very good english-american-hybrid IPA with 'rapadura' (a candy made of molasses). Invicta is one of my favorites from here, having from humble Weizenbiers to Imperial American IPAs, all very good.
Don't miss Empório Alto dos Pinheiros (EAP), the best craft-beer bar in the city, with 30+ taps and excellent food at a fair price. Ah, well, prices overall here aren't very good.

I became aware of them last year completely by accident, in a trip to UK, and loved their Modus Operandi beer. I also had another very light pale sour wich wasn't remarkable compared to the first one, but fairly ok. (I guess it probably should have had more time in the bottle to develop and reach its full potential).

Sours beers are not for everyone, and the common first reaction to them is negative. But, if one get over that first shocking experience, go on and try it again, people usually fall in love with it.

They are called Wild because they use in their fermentation process, in addition to possible other yeasts, brettanomyces yeast, also known as wild yeast, a different species, found in some kinds of wine and belgians beers (lambics, flanders red), which gives very rustic but complex and delightful aromas to the beer. It doesn't actually makes a beer sour (it actually produces a very small amount of acid only), but ""wild"" beers usually have other types of what is called bugs (bacteria and other fungi) in it, which does leave a lot of acid to the final beer, making it sour.

They also have regular beers (IPA, Saison, Pale Ale), and they're almost always creative and daring on their recipes. I guess, whether you like it or not, all their beers are worth a try, because those guys seem to take brewing very seriously and you can expect nothing less than quality stuff.

I wish I was still there to taste all their beers.

And a bonus: they're from Evercreech, soutwest. ;) Look it up at their site and see what they've got.

Belgians themselves don't give a damn about style definitions actually. They only follow their traditions (from the region where they live, their monastery, their community, whatever).

So, you are going to find beers varying from very shinning blonde to dark/ruby and thick ones that almost resembles a wine, which is the case of Westvleteren 12, that one being the myth it is because it is not sold (at least officially) outside the monastery, and one is supposed to schedule and go pick it up personally with an amount limit, and everything. Off course, although I'm sure it is a really good beer (I've never had it), all that difficulty to get it undeniably contributes to its fame.

I find Rochefort 10 (a belgian dark strong ale as Westvleteren 12) one of (if not the) best, certainly my very favorite on the list, but on the other end of the flavor range, Achel 10 (a strong golden ale) is my favorite blonde/pale trappist as well.

La Trappe, which is the biggest trappist brewery, has at least twice the labels other breweries have, and is widely available on market, still has very good beers.

So, the short answer is: trappist is not a style, and there's no such thing as the best one. It all depends on what you like, so, taste all them. Even nowadays, with some new-age trappist beers popping up, there aren't still so many out there, so tasting all trappist beers is pretty feasible in short time (except for Westvleteren, off course).

3481,2,,2015-07-19T15:03:20.523,1,,"(I'm assuming here you mean spontaneous fermentation, used originally in belgian lambics. Open fermentation is the practice of fermenting in an open vessel but in a controlled environment, not allowing other microorganisms to get in, like Anchor and Sierra Nevada still do these days, and sometime ago very common in the industry.)

You will probably never get a definitive answer to it but based only in my theoretical knowledge I would say terroir is not so determinant as people use to think, even for spontaneously fermented beer.

My first guess is that, aside from very extreme/sterile climates and landscapes, microflora in the air is pretty much the same, at least in terms of variety and the species that play a main role in spontaneously fermented beer, which aren't much more than a few (acetobacteria, sacharomyces, lactic bacteria and brettanomyces). I know, you can find hundreds of different bugs in a single lambic, but from all that, only a few really play an important role. You can see this study here from UC Davis, based on Allagash's Coolship.

One thing that supports this argument is that american breweries are successfully making lambic-style beers following almost the exact same traditional process as the belgian. But, then, one thing they've already learned is that one of the main factors in the early process of inoculation and fermentation is temperature, what implies year's season as well. Usually they leave the wort to be inoculated over night at fall. You can listen to what people from Allagash say about their Coolship Ale, for example.

The rest of the process, well, now it depends on infinite factors (barrels, wood, storage, temperature, etc). But, your question was about distance between places, what suggests the terroir aspect of the production. So, I would say (and that's a completely wild guess), since you're in a place surrounded by any vegetation, with a minimum of biodiversity, and have wind, it doesn't make a big deal of a difference.

Oh, and don't forget one thing. You get (if so) a consistent and regular flavor from those kind of beers only because people blend it before releasing, once different barrels even of the same batch turn out to be completely different one from the other. So, again, that's why I think there isn't much sense to talk about terroir. It's not like grapes are to wines.

PS1: Off course, as climate does play a crucial role in the process, it doesn't surprise me people are doing this only in the northern hemisphere at temperate climates. I guess it wouldn't work out very well in a tropical country, which doesn't have well definite seasons, although spontaneous fermentation can be done anywhere, you just can't guarantee what is going to come out of it.

PS2: If you are heavily interested in the topic, as I am, I recommend that you listen to Savor's Salons about barrel aging and blending, and sour/wild beers, available at Craft Beer Radio. There has been a lot of talkings about the matter in the last years. Really interesting.

3483,2,,2015-07-19T16:43:53.813,1,,"Beer barrel-aging is a complex topic, and there's more than one reason for doing it.

It has become a common practice in the american industry to age strong beers in barrels (mostly ex-bourbon oak barrels, but no only), to mellow it and add another layer of flavors (almost the same thing that happens with whisky). It's very common with Imperial Stouts, for example, which is one of the styles that goes best with this kind of practice. Generally, boozy and dark beers are more suitable for this, but not only (people age belgian tripels, for example, which, while being sometimes boozy, aren't roasty at all).

So, talking about oak, you get that vanilla, coconut, sherry flavors, sometimes some smoke from the barrel's inside toast, and things like that. Boozines is softened as well (mellowed). Off course, inside the barrel, a lot of complex reactions occurs, and I don't know how it can be compared with wine chemically, but, along with other compounds, tannins are incorporated to the beer, altough it doesn't always appear so much in the final product like in wines. It all depends on a series of factors, including the amount of time the liquid spends in the barrel.

Besides it, some aeration and in consequence oxidation does occur, but that's not the main purpose in that ""type"" of aging. Flavors of the original barrel's content may be picked as well, in higher or lower levels.

Another main use of barrels in the beer industry is for production of wild/sour beers, in that case, the micro-aeration being a main desired factor. When people want to sour their beers and/or develop wild characteristics in it, they use different organisms after the primary fermentation. In order to sour it they use bacteria and for the rustic (wild) flavors they use another kind of yeast called brettanomyces in a further step of fermentation/maturation, in which oxygen presence is fundamental, but a slow pace is mandatory as well to avoid an overgrowth of the organisms and a possible ""spoilage"" of the beer. So, the barrel is a perfect place for this process to take place, because wood allows the oxygen to get in very slowly. Besides it, the barrel itself becomes a colony house for all those bugs (as brewers call those wild microorganisms), so you may not even need to pitch any yeast/bacteria after some time anymore. Off course, the wood alone impairs some flavors to the beer as well. You end up with a very, very complex product.

These days, people are doing all kinds of crazy experiments you can think of, and there's no mandatory rule when using barrels. It all depends on what result you want to achieve and real-world experience as well. There's a lot of methods, and every one is still figuring it out.

3484,2,,2015-07-20T00:20:14.743,3,,"Well, when it comes to very hoppy beers nowadays, I can't help thinking about American IPAs. It's not even close to any german style, off course, but if you are looking for hops, that's the one style to go for.

Fortunately, there are some german microbreweries making IPAs there, like Hans Müller Sommelierbier's Backbone Splitter IPA, Ale-Mania's Imperial IPA and Crew IPA. I just don't know how available they are over there.

In general, german styles aren't so hop-forward, favoring balance over excess. Styles like Munich Helles and German Pilsners have a definite hop profile, which I find just the exact right amount to balance malt and compose the aroma profile, but nothing overwhelming like an IPA. The rare doppelstick style (double altbier) has a high IBU count, but just to balance the malt sweetness, which is massive in this style, and not to stand alone.

Californian brewery Stone is going to open a production plant in Berlin soon, so their beers will be available when it kicks off. And, just in case you aren't aware, Californian beers = loads of hops. So, keep an eye open.

Off course, if you're a hophead, your best bet is to wait for Stone to kick-off their production and distribution there.

As an advice: give german styles a chance too. In general, they're much less extreme than american ones, and definitely not hop-forward, but they have their own beauty. They're delicate, balanced and diverse. If you really like beer, explore as much as you can. You're probably going to find something that pleases you. ;)

They are doing primary fermentation with Brettanomyces for many styles, including popular ones, like IPAs (look for brett ipa on Google). I don't know very specific details about the strains used for it, but I do know there are a few ones in the market right know. Probably some of them are more suitable for it than other ones.

As far as I know, Brett doesn't take longer than any ale yeast to ferment (primarily), and gives a slightly different aroma and taste profile, but nothing funky like it does in secondary fermentation/maturation, which is that slow process you probably have heard of, when it eats complex sugars and other compounds, ending up with that barnyard aroma. And contrary to what many people think, it doesn't acidify the beer (brett produces only a small amount of acid, not enough to sour it). When people want to brew sours, they use bacteria.

Actually, at a glance, 100% brett beers aren't so different from beers fermented with Saccharomyces. Off course, this is completely different from adding brett to the bootle and letting it to develop over time.

Why brewers are doing it? A guess they ask the exact opposite: you should we not do this? =)

3488,2,,2015-07-20T20:40:48.710,4,,"Well, that style thing is complicated because in real world people just make beer, and don't make beer to satisfy styles guides (at least, not until very recentely when some people started to care more about style guidelines than the beer itself).

Anyway, what I think is important to be aware is:


Many styles have a long and old history, often centuries, and what we have as one nowadays doesn't have much to do with what it was once ago.
Styles change a lot over time as well. I'm not a specialist, but I think before the american craft beer revolution and revival in the early 80's, no one was gathering and classifying beer styles in a guide like BJCP. And that same revival brought back to life many dead styles in different fashion (well, look the case of IPAs), by the way.
Generally, despite style guides, people have their own understanding of what is X or Y, and when naming their beers, they will do it based on their perception and references too, not strictly style guidelines.
If you look closer, porter and stout are ancient reference styles for more specific and contemporaneous styles (sweet stout, dry stout, outmeal stout, brown porter, robust porter, russian imperial stout, etc).


So, I think it makes more sense telling the difference between a milk and an outmeal stout, or brown and baltic porter than stout X porter.

For what's worth, for me, there's no difference between stout and porter. What I mean is, at least not so that we, as consumers, can trust and be 100% of what you are going to get if you choose one over the other, specially when the name is generic like that.

What I think is enlightening is to understand the history of those related styles and how they came to be what they are today.

3493,2,,2015-07-22T18:59:48.807,1,,"Effectively, yes.  A sour beer is what we'd consider to be a spoiled beer.  

As a quick primer, ""wort"" is turned into ""beer"" when microbes convert the sugars in the liquid into alcohol, CO2, and ...other stuff.  Generally speaking, we use brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae for ale or Sacc. Pastorianus for lager) because the other stuff tastes pretty nice, or at least doesn't taste bad.  Various strains of the same organism produce different byproducts, an example would be an English ale yeast which is well known for compounds that are kindof sweet or fruity vs Belgian ale yeasts which are well known for being peppery, clovy, or banana-y.  Those flavors all come from the yeast used for fermentation, but it's only ever a single strain of yeast, which was isolated in a lab.

Sour beers are basically defined by not using a single isolated, clean-tasting strain of Saccharomyces.  The most common sour yeast used is in a genus called Brettanomyces, which depending on the specific species can produce flavors like...horse saddle, bandaid, cheese, cloves, and vinegar.  But most sour beers are not strictly brewed with yeasts like Sacc. or Brett. but also have bacteria in them.  Most commonly lactobacillus and pediococcus which are known for producing large amounts of lactic acid, which is where the sour really comes from.

That's not to say sour beer brewers are being sloppy, because their ""infections"" aren't accidents.  They're deliberately trying to use less predictable and slow-acting organisms to create consistent beer.  That's tough.

As to a suggestion?  I like Tart of Darkness by The Bruery.  Petrus is good stuff and Duchesse de Bourgogne is nice.  Occasionally it's nice to find a really tart Berlinerweisse and mix it with a fruit syrup and Gose can be incredible paired with cheese.

Compare the new number to the first number.  If they're the same, you're safe.  If they're at all different, give it another week then repeat the whole process.

3495,2,,2015-07-22T20:21:50.240,4,,"Sourness may have been, in a higher or lower level, a common characteristic of beers centuries ago, specially after some time of storage, once the common vessel to keep it was wooden barrels, and wood often harbor a lot of microorganisms, including bacteria and wild yeast, the former being responsible for souring the beer. After the Industrial Revolution, with more hygiene and sterile tools, that characteristic became more and more uncommon, and at some point, undesirable. So, meanwhile, yeast was ""discovered"", isolated, and fermentation controlled so that we had a clean taste profile, free from acids at all, which is what you know as beer nowadays.

Don't be fooled: what really sours a beer are bacteria, not Brettanomyces. The later, also known as 'wild yeast', are usually found in sour beers as well, but are responsible for other aromas and flavors (barnyard and horse saddle being the most recognizable). (Brett actually produces a tiny amount of acid, no more than that).

Some Belgians have been intentionally making sour beers for centuries, through spontaneous fermentation process (in the case of lambics) and wood-aging (in large oak vats) after ""clean"" fermentation (in the case of flanders reds). Germans did it too, but their two traditional sour styles (gose and berliner weisse) are almost dead there, and differ from the belgians ones on the absence of brett character.

Nonetheless, nowadays people comprehend a lot better how those processes occur, and are doing sours again on purpose and manipulating those organisms in many ways. Basically, souring bacteria used are pediococcus and lactobacillus (not very different from lambics, actually). Most of the time, barrels are still used in the process, because of the micro-aeration those microorganisms need. And, off course, for keeping the microflora inside it, etc, etc, not to mention the flavor complexity that comes from wood compounds itself.

A contaminated beer may end up being a sour. Well, so what distinguish a spoiled beer from a sour? Nothing actually, except that when people intentionally want to produce a sour, they do that with some more control in order to get the outcome they want and not some weird aleatory taste at the end. But, at some level, producing a sour beer, specially when using barrels, is always unpredictable too.

As you can see, it's a rich and complex topic, probably the most exciting one about brewing.

As suggestions, I definitely encourage you to taste the classic ones, belgian lambics (any Gueuze you find) and flanders reds (have you ever heard about Rodenbach and Duchesse de Bourgogne? they're amazing). I love Petrus Aged Pale too.

And, if you are from US, then you are bloody blessed, because american craft brewers are doing sour/wild beers like there were no tomorrow. =P Look for Allagash, Russian River, Lost Abbey, The Bruery, Avery, Boulevard, Almanac, Deschutes. The list is infinite. The thing is getting so serious that in the last years, all-sour breweries are popping up, like Rare Barrel from Berkeley.

There are even some well-know craft beers which have already been distilled into whiskys, like Samuel Adams' Boston Lager.

3498,2,,2015-07-24T04:14:07.003,4,,"In 1821, the four Rodenbach brothers (Pedro, Alexander, Ferdinand and Constantijn) invested in a small brewery in Roeselare, in the West Flanders province of Belgium. The brothers agreed to a partnership for 15 years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth.

Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbachs until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.

There are 4 different types of Rodenbach beers:
 1. Rodenbach Original (5,2% ABV) blended from aged and young ale (25%/75%);
 2. Rodenbach Grand Cru, a rich winey beer (6% ABV) which, although blended, contains less young ale (67%/33%) (in the past this beer was unblended aged beer from a single cask selected for its qualities by a tasting panel. This type of beer has now been renamed Rodenbach Vintage beer and is available in limited quantities);
 3. Vin de Céréale, an aged beer that is 10% ABV.
 4. In commemoration of the brewery 150th year of activity, it produced Rodenbach Alexander (5,2% ABV). It was a variant of the Original one with a cherry taste. It is name comes from the brewery founder Alexander Rodenbach.

After the take-over, Palm quickly stopped the production of Rodenbach's Alexander beer, a cherry-flavoured beer.[1] When Palm Brewery bought Rodenbach, another brewery it owned already made a cherry beer. At that time Alexander Rodenbach had to be ceased for contractual non-compete sorts of reasons. However, in recent years, Palm/Rodenbach has produced and distributed, first, Rodenbach foederbier, which is served only from cask, and is unfiltered and unblended. It comes straight from an oak riping barrel and is not processed further.

I think the bartender told you to drink your Rodenbach with a shot of cherry liquor, so that you can taste the original Rodenbach Alexander (the cherry-flavoured beer, Rodenbach's erstwhile cherry beer which produced before the brewery was sold to Palm).

When you pour from the storage vessel to the glass you disturb the beer a lot which drives CO2 gas out, and that takes a lot of aromatics with it so the aroma you get from the beer in a glass is WAY stronger and more complex than what you'd sniff from the bottle or can.

Also smell is a pretty huge part of tasting something and when you drink from a glass you're putting your nose right into the thick of all that, so the flavor will be more intense as well.  Bottles and cans sort of keep that toned down since you don't smell the beer as much.

There used to be a prejudice against cans because the liquid and the aluminum would react and oxidize, but they started coating the insides with a food safe epoxy resin decades ago and it's completely sealed now.  As far as taste goes there's no difference between the two, but cans actually store a bit better because they let in no light and no air while bottles will eventually let through enough to affect the beer.  Brewers like cans as well since they're more portable, don't shatter, chill faster, and are often cheaper to fill.

The older it is, the worse it will taste, but having drunk more than one in a sitting, I can safely say it's no more harmful than drinking a fresh one. Never gotten sick off one, but it's pretty hard to down them without gagging a bit.

Some beers actually seem to intentionally go for a similar taste. Anything with a green bottle seems to be trying for a skunky flavor, while brown bottles help filter out damaging light. Compare a Beck's or Heineken to, say, a Budweiser.  The former will have a distinctly skunky flavor to them, basically similar to marijuana. The latter has a bit of a rice taste, as that's what's used in the brewing process, with a slight sweetness, but overall just a bubbly light flavor.

As Linus pointed out, there's going to be a ""wet cardboard"" taste with past-due light lagers. I'm guessing this is due to the breakdown of oils and sugars in the beer, as well as other general chemical changes. I'm not sure why it has that taste of cardboard or paper, but it's definitely present. After doing some research (aka looking it up on google), I found that the main culprit of that cardboard taste is a chemical called ""nonenal"". It's apparently also a chemical in human body odor of aged people, leading to the so-called ""old people smell"". This isn't proven, but there's some evidence that this is the main culprit for the somewhat-neutral scent of older people's perspiration. In a beer, not quite as neutral, however.

1) Wine. No way. If someone is going to generically order wine, they at least specify a color, red or white. Plus wine is mostly all the same strength, only varying a couple percent either direction, unless you count fortified wines, which are another topic. 

2) Beer. Ordering a generic beer would get you a basic beer, which isn't very strong. Only a few specialized beer bars would have any beers that I'd call really strong. Any beer stronger than 12% is going to be very rare, with most bars not even having above 8%. The kinds of people who order strong beers, these 8, 9, 10, etc beers, would always order by name. They are craft beer fans. These aren't really strong enough to help someone in distress. 

3) Vodka. Unless you are a Russian or a huge vodka fan, you don't order vodka straight like this. Vodka is generally for mixing in America. The people who are serious about vodka drinking would order by brand name.

4) Gin is the same story as vodka really. Gin in generally served in mixed form, although a dry gin martini is close to 100% gin, it still counts as mixed. 

5) Cordials, liquers, etc. Again, would be ordered by type or brand, and often not that strong compared to the main liquors. 

6) Rum, can be quite strong, makes decent shots, makes decent sipping. But it conjours up images of pirate and or topical locations. If the movie is set in the Caribbean, they would mean rum. 

7) Tequila. It's strong, makes good shots. Not so great for sipping, unless you are talking about the really good stuff or you are a tequila fan. If you are in Mexico or a Cantina, they would mean tequila. 

8) Whiskey. This is the winning category. It's always strong. It tastes good in shots, and makes fine sipping from a glass. This is manly and good for all classes of life. Blue collars and white collars alike love whiskey. if you are doing, ""forget your troubles"" kinda drinking, whiskey is the best choice. If you are sad, or upset, or worried, or looking for a fight, or anything like that, whiskey is the best choice. A real American manly man is going to want whiskey, usually bourbon, something like Knob's Creek. Some will prefer Irish whiskeys, or Scottish Whiskys, (notice no e), but if they do, they will say so by name. 

I mean, I know if I was upset like that and going to a bar and said a stupid order like gimme a strong one, I would mean bourbon. If I wanted a beer, to get back on topic, I'd be like, ""What kind of IPAs you got?"" ""Any sours?""

Bottles that can't move only foam a little bit, where the hitting bottle foams as much as the hit bottle.

Bottles that can move (even 1 mm is enough) move down faster than the beer. This creates a lower pressure inside the bottle. 
Beer can hold a lot less CO2 at lower pressure so any bubble that can grow, will grow and new ones will form at an increased rate.
The top bottle will have an equal but opposite pressure change, but increased pressure just increases the amount of CO2 that the beer can hold so no extra foam will be produced here.

Fun sidenote: If you hit hard enough the pressure in the hit bottle gets low enough to create a small and very short lived vacuum at the bottom of the bottle, the beer rushes towards the vacuum with such power that the bottom of the bottle breaks off. You can also do this with your hand instead of with another bottle. How to Break a Beer Bottle With Your Bare Hands.

—from left to right, their Wheat Ale, Amber Ale, Dark Lager, Summer Red Ale (my favorite, but seasonal only), and IPA.

There's also Prague Beer Museum near Old Town, a few blocks northeast of the famous astronomical clock tower. The name's a little misleading—it's just a beer garden with some bar food (not great). Most of the beers were lagers (pilsners, dark), with a few IPAs and other styles scattered about. I wasn't a huge fan of their selection, but perhaps I was being closed-minded. Relative to San Diego standards, their one porter on draft tasted more like barleywine (...unaged, blegh), their one pale ale tasted skunky to me, and their IPAs tasted like they were afraid to use too much hops :-) If you check it out and have a different experience, please let me know.

City center - U Fleku - very popular among tourists, nice atmosphere, not very cheap though
North of Prague - Pivovar U Bulovky - nice small brewery, locals mainly, near tram
North of Prague - Pivovar Kolčavka - very nice brewery, good food, locals mainly, close to Palmovka Metro (underground)
Southern Prague - Jihomestsky pivovar - again, very good beer and food, near Metro Háje
Southern Prague - Pivovar Hostivar - one of the best gardens, nice beer and food, only about two years old, quite far from Metro (Hostivar or Haje)


And sure much more, but these are some of those I remember or have experienced myself.

You can ask for anything in particular, if you want.

There is a number of beers that I remember having always been there, and a few have been added over time. But these don’t stick out much in price or flavour.

Recently, I heard the term micro brewery for the first time, and I noticed that large supermarkets have stocked up on many different (mostly regional) beers. Prices start at “slightly above average”, but some are easily ten times as expensive. A bottle of beer for 7 Euros? Not the most expensive.

This, and the fact that beer.stackexchange.com exists, and that many questions concern micro breweries and craft beers leads me to the questions:

Why this sudden interest in micro breweries and craft beers? When did it start?

4532,2,,2015-08-17T19:12:19.597,3,,"I'm not sure about the German market for craft, but American craft can almost certainly be traced back to Frederick Maytag's purchase of San Francisco's Anchor Brewing in 1965. Since then, 'craft' or 'microbrew' grew slowly through the years.

A lengthy but interesting report called THE MARKET FOR CRAFT AND SPECIALTY BEER, A Market Intelligence Report, March 1997 has an impressive description of why craft in particular was able to keep growing, and why it wasn't labeled a 'fad':


  ""There is also a floor under the craft/specialty segment. This is not
  a fad segment like packaged draft, dry, ice, clear, or perhaps even
  red. While growth in the craft segment will slow, it will not peak
  quickly and then lose share, as the fad beers have. The
  craft/specialty segment has firm underpinnings from homebrewers and
  other beer aficionados. Many of the homebrewers prefer to brew their
  own beer (done right, it’s even better than the best of the craft
  brews), but they often sample commercial brews to try unfamiliar or
  difficult-to-brew styles, and of course they’re top prospects for
  drinking craft brews when they are at a restaurant or brewpub.""


That explains a lot through the 90's, but why the quicker increase in growth patterns in the last 10 years?

According to the Brewers Association (a US-based trade group): 


  ""Between 2011 and 2013, 80% of craft growth came from new craft
  appreciators, the majority of which were in the 21 to 29 age group,
  and their impact is still muted. Lester Jones of the National Beer
  Wholesalers Association (NBWA) sees Millennials as not fully
  economically activated yet due to the impact of the economic recession
  and their struggle to transition into aging Baby Boomer jobs. This
  means as the economy improves we should feel the impact of the
  Millennials even more. The message here is the fastest growing and
  most influential demographic is also moving the fastest toward craft.""


Pair this with the increased ideals behind ""Trade-ups and premiumization"", and you have people willing to spend a little more to gain an perceived increase in value and quality.

IBISWorld shares that craft beer has enjoyed a 19% growth in the past 5 years. I don't know about you, but that's incredible considering the economic woes of developed nations. 

It appears to boil down to a long, slow pattern of growth that has reached a massive generational shift in consumption which has caused a spike in sales volume, which in turn is pushing every store from New Jersey to Frankfurt to attempt to capitalize on one of the few growth industries.

More recently I had the opportunity to try Köstritzer, which I guess would be classified as a black lager. It had the very familiar taste of a stout but without the filling quality. 

Black lager seems to be a rather generic category though, the title seems to cover a rather large variety of dark lagers and seems to be more about color than taste. 

Is there a more specific category I should be looking for?

Or perhaps better, does any one know any other beers that taste like a stout but with the light weight of a lager?

English mild ale has a lower alcoholic content than bitter or Guinness, generally dark coloured.  Theakstons make a particularly nice mild on an irregular basis.

Scottish 60 shilling (60/-) or light beer is similar to mild but is generally slightly sweeter to suit the Scottish palate.  McEwan's 60/- is the one most commonly seen.

It should be noted that this class of beer is generally out of favour in the UK despite efforts by the Campaign for Real Ale to revive interest.

Dunkelweizen
This is a dark wheat beer with characteristics of a traditional wheat with caramel type flavors joining the mix. Not exactly stout-like, but more like your black lager in lightness.
Schwarzbier
Schwarzbier means &quot;black beer&quot; in German. This is what you had with your  Köstritzer. It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid.
Black IPA / Cascadian Dark Ale
The American fascination with hops has shown that the addition of toasted malts can give a hoppy, bitter, and coffee-like experience to these beers.
Black Saisons
Similar to the Black IPA, I've seen a few breweries start brewing their saisons with roasted malts. The usual light flavors of the saison are accented by this extra roasted character. It's never acrid, however.
Porters
A lot of English porters are not heavy at all, and are generally akin to milds that have roasted malts added in. Look for lower ABV porters in the 4-5% range, and you'll probably find something you like.
Surprisingly to many, Guinness is actually on par with any other beer of similar alcohol strength, as beer gets a majority of its calories from alcohol, about 7 per gram. Perhaps much of the 'full' feeling is a product of the use of nitrogen in the mix which gives it that creamy texture.

4555,2,,2015-08-27T19:44:22.187,5,,"I'd say it comes down to three things.

Distribution Rights

Breweries in most states are restricted by the three-tier system which divides the brewing industry into three categories:


Producers
Distributors
Retailers.


A few states allow the producer to engage in self-distribution (usually to a limited degree) but most require that a brewery get distribution rights with a third party, which will hold full, exclusive, and unlimited rights to shipping that producer's beer. ProBrewer.com has some excellent reading on the subject.


  The rules and regulations pertaining to the distribution and advertising of beer products are highly regulated and are enacted and enforced at the state level. Therefore, each state has its own set of laws in which the brewer is responsible for knowing and abiding by. It is incumbent on you, the brewer, to know the specific regulations of each state in which you sell.


It boils down to what the distributor wants to do and state-by-state requirements for what can be sold there. Ohio has a cap on alcohol by volume of 12%. Any beer over 4% ABV in Oklahoma must be sold only at liquor stores at room temperature. It varies so much that some brewers don't want to go into those markets.

Demand

There's also the simple issue of supply and demand. In 2013, Founders Brewing delayed entering the Florida market for a few months while they brought on more 600BBL fermenters because of some slight under-reporting of potential market numbers. There's nothing worse than not being able to supply your customers with beer. (Ahem, Cigar City's Great Jai-Alai Shortage of 2013).

Expense

Bottling/canning beer is expensive. There's also only a certain amount of time available to package. This is why there will usually be only a certain number and type of beer that gets packaged in these containers until a brewery grows to a certain size that allows better economies of scale. Once there, it's easier to start releasing seasonals, one-offs, and more nuanced beer styles compared to just cranking out a wheat ale or amber ale.

Meanwhile, some styles taste better aged, e.g. barleywines, imperial souts, sours. You definitely wouldn't see a ""Best by:"" for these types, and in fact you might even see a ""Best after:"". So perhaps the ""Born on:"" label is a way of letting the enthusiast decide how long to age a beer, without feeling forced to wait a minimum number of months or years.

Would you happen to know or remember the styles (or even better, the exact name) of the beers that said ""Best by:"" vs. ""Born on:""? Then perhaps we could validate or invalidate this explanation.



Edit

Interestingly, Anheiser-Busch is the only entity that may use ""Born on:"", as they've trademarked it.

But anyway, it turns out that another class of beers that typically have production dates are macros (i.e. American Adjunct Lagers), not because they taste better aged, but for a mix of several reasons:


profit-maximization (purportedly),
tracking problems and policing freshness,
giving consumers an (illusory) sense of regulatory safety,
and giving enthusiasts control over when they'd like to consume a beer.


A Lagunitas employee quoted in the aforementioned link claims that


  Bud only really did it to reduce brewery and distributor inventories and wring a one-time load of cash out of the company...


and goes on to say that Lagunitas labels production dates


  to track problems [...] and to give our distributors the ability (if they will use it) to police freshness.


A bit biased, but I can believe some elements of both sides.

Furthermore, these threads on BeerAdvocate suggest that some consumers feel better (even might only drink a beer) when a production date is printed, whether it gives them an illusory sense of regulatory safety or they actually know enough about beer to know if and how long to age them.

First, ales are traditional served warmer than pilseners, so start your selection there. 

Second consideration is sweet/bitter balance. Sweetness generally becomes stronger with warmer beer. Something with a bit of sour would probably hold up well when warm. At the same time, styles that are meant to be sweet are usually served at/close to room temp: barleywines, or anything imperial/double/doppel/strong. Bonus: you won't have to carry as much.

The occasional offering that we sell (Niagara College Teaching Brewery), uses oysters at the end of the mash regime (hot soaking of the grains). The idea here is that you are extracting calcium carbonate from the shells, which helps reduce the tannic astringency that can result from the roasted grains used in stouts. This is the same reason/benefit that stouts are traditionally brewed in areas with relatively hard water. It also happens to be the perfect temperature for cooking oysters. 

Oysters cooked or uncooked could be added at other parts of the process, but may not have the same impact on reducing astringency. There is a subtle undertone of the oyster that makes it into the finished product, but your palate may vary and may or may not detect it (depending on process and quantity used).

Currently, no. 

According to the latest Beer Judge Certification Program guidelines (the drafted 2015 style guide http://www.bjcp.org/docs/2015_Guidelines_Beer.pdf), there is no category of XPA or Extra Pale Ale.

Stylistically, depending on the malt bill used, one would place the beer in either an American Pale Ale or IPA category, though most 'sub styles' the BJCP wants to have in the 21B. Specialty IPA category. If it was heavy in British malts, perhaps even an English IPA. 

This doesn't mean, however, that a brewery can't just make up whatever they feel like to call their beer, which is what I believe is happening there. XPA sounds cool, new, and interesting.

The idea of the style has been around for a few years, at least back to 2013 as referenced by this HomeBrewTalk forum post. Even then there were debates as to the meaning of this style... and it still hasn't become anything of note.

The other method is to use an overpressure of gas to push beer out.  The gas can be CO2, Nitrogen or air.  The pressure is usually generated by some form of pump.  For Real Ale the handpump is the device of choice forcing air onto the beer and powered by human.  In some places in Scotland the handpump is replaced by a water powered pump because Scots are engineers.

When the real ale resurrection happened in the 70s barmaids were actually warned to swap hands used to pull the pump lest they increase the muscles on one side and became lopsided as it were.

Pressurized gas.  As mentioned by the other answer this is most commonly CO2 since CO2 is produced by yeast, so if you sealed the container while yeast were still processing sugars and producing CO2, they would pressurize the container.  Some brewers, especially home brewers, will pressurize their kegs through natural carbonation but most just push CO2 from a canister.  BUT there's also ""beer gas"" which is a mix of Nitrogen and CO2, think Guinness or Boddingtons.  This came into use to emulate the soft carbonation of cask/real ale/kellerbier, which leads to:
Siphoning.  A hand pump, or beer engine, uses a siphon to ""pull"" the beer out of the cask and up to the tap.  The physics needs atmospheric pressure to be maintained inside the cask, so it's usually open to the air at the top.  This required a fast turnaround on casks to prevent the beer from spoiling, which is one of the reasons cask/""real"" ale fell out favor.  Kegs simply kept longer and were more economical.  I think CAMRA still isn't a fan of them, but some bars use ""breathers"" which basically add very low pressures of CO2 to replace the volume lost by the beer, but not enough to pressurize the cask.  This just lets the beer last longer in the cask.
Gravity pouring.  This tends to happen most often at festivals or if a bar has a ""guest cask"".  A spout is installed in the side and beer pours out.  All the caveats about air spoilage from cask ale still exist here.


So if the bartender pulls a handle and leaves it there until the glass is full of beer, that's a pressurized gas system.  If the bartender has to keep pulling the handle to fill the glass and the beer has that cool ""cascading"" look, it was pulled by siphoning.  If the cask is on the bar and the bartender just opens a spigot...that's a gravity pour.

I don't know that there are any other options...maybe an open barrel and ladling the beer out like soup?

4605,2,,2015-09-24T18:43:42.550,7,,"This is a simple question to ask but has a longer answer with a ton of complexities you probably don't care about if you are not brewing your own.  Ultimately sweet beers are part of the style they are in so avoiding sugary sweet beers is as simple as knowing the styles.  You can skip to the bottom if that's all you want to know.
There are two types of sweetness that are often discussed and sometimes confused in beer, a Malty flavor and a Sweet flavor. The same ingredients are involved but in different ways.  Sugary sweet beers basically come from unfermented sugars which simply means sugars that the yeast hasn't processed to create alcohol and carbon dioxide.  This is also called attenuation.
This can be caused by a few different things such as unfermentable sugars that come from the way the beer is mashed (when the grains are mixed in with hot water and left to sit for a specific length of time) or from specialty grains, or the yeast itself.
The explanation of how the mash affects sweetness is very complex and full of biochemistry.  I will try to summarize.  Grains are full of starches that need to be converted to sugar for the yeast to ferment.  There are two main enzymes involved in this process, alpha and beta amylase enzymes.  Using a branched tree analogy works great.  After a strong storm you need to clean up your yard from the limbs that have fallen from the trees.  You have a lopper (alpha amylase) which is great for cutting the branches apart from the limbs but still leave you with long branches and twigs.  You also have a chipper (beta amylase) which is good at taking the branches and twigs and cutting them into little pieces that are easy to use.  The two enzymes need to do their work together to make the most fermentable sugars out of the starches stored in the grains.  Alpha amylase is good at breaking the limbs apart into long starch chains but these are not easy for yeast to ferment.  Beta amylase is great at making small glucose chains that the yeast can convert but the big limbs are too big to get into the chipper, if the alpha amylase doesn't do its job first the beta amylase can't do its job well.
The kicker is each enzyme works in a specific temperature range (beta amylase 131-150°F and alpha amylase 154-162°F).  A brewer can manipulate the mash temperature to ensure both enzymes are working with an overlapping temperature (for instance 152°F) or adjust the temperature up or down to accentuate one enzyme over the other.  For instance if we mashed at 158°F the beta amylase will denature and not affect the beer, while the alpha amylase will be very happy and busy.  This will result in more long starch molecules in the beer which are harder for yeast to ferment and result in a sweeter beer!
Unfermentable sugars can also come from specialty grains added to the beer for flavor and intentional sweetness.  The usual suspects are roasted grains where the sugars inside the grain will start to caramelize such as Dark caramel and roasted malts like Crystal 80, Crystal 120, Special B, Chocolate Malt, and Roast Barley.  Below is a great place for people to start learning the intricacies of brewing beer at home.
Increasing the Body
Ultimately these things are done by brewers to make their beer fit into the style they are trying to make along with other things like the amount and type of hops used and other adjuncts (stuff added to beer like fruit or rice or...)  So to avoid sugary beers you mainly need to know what styles are not sweet or it's as simple as saying know what types of beers you like.  If you really want to learn the styles turn to the Beer Style Guide!
2008 BJCP Style Guidelines
Look around and see which are sweet and avoid, meanwhile look for highly attenuated beers.  I'd expect some you would like are:

German Pilsners
American Lagers and Pilsners
Berliner-Style Weisse
Dunkel Weizen/Dunkel Weissbier
Munich Helles
Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale
Pale Ales shouldn't be too sweet
Kölsch
IPAs should be dry

If you want to be adventurous, try a Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer.  They are supposed to be dry although I can't speak from experience.

It is was evident from a early stage in the history of brewing that these hops where only made in a handful of places in the old world and the beer culture centered around these places.

4643,2,,2015-10-19T03:55:20.977,5,,"So I'm going to assume you mean historically...

The Wikipedia page has a ton of good info but basically, beer was originally a very sweet beverage due to the wild yeast and under modified malt that was used in the brewing process.  To combat the sweetness, brewers would use Gruit which is an herb mixture to bitter the beer. Hops were also used as a bittering agent, but not to the same extent as gruit.

In 1842, the first Pilsner was brewed, a style which showcases hops and is very pale in color which was revolutionary at the time.  This style took Europe by storm and the migrating Germans to the US brought this taste for hoppy pilsners with them to the US.  There were many competing styles that were popular in the US up until Prohibition.
 After prohibition, the breweries that were still in business chose to produce the beers that appeal to the widest consumer base, I.E. Pilsner drinkers. This is the raison d'etre for the very large breweries.

As for the bitterness in beer, the most common factor is Hops.  Hops contain different acids (Alpha, Beta, Myrcente, etc) that bitter beer in different ways.  The type, quantity and usage of hops in the brewing process can affect the bitterness of beer.
That being said, some styles don't use a lot of hops if at all.  Scottish/Irish ales, for instance, don't have much hop flavor due to the lack of availability of hops in the region.  Other styles originate from locations that have never seen hops.

Hope this helps.  Never be afraid to try new things.

After prohibition ended, it was up to the states and counties to determine their own stance toward alcohol.  One part of the repeal of the 18th Amendment was the legalization of homebrewing wine and mead.  The law did not allow the homebrewing of beer until 1978.  Event then, it was up to each state to determine their stance toward the homebrewing of beer.

The states with the most breweries per capita follow the federal statute, which allows for 100 gallons per person of drinking age up to a maximum of 200 gallons per year. The states on the map with the least breweries have only recently relaxed their laws on homebrewing and alcohol sales in general. 

Many homebrewers dream of starting their own brewery or pub, but they need to be able to practice their craft.  I am unable to locate the minutes to the Alabama House of Rep. discussion online, but the Basic Brewing Radio Podcast did air a snipped of the floor arguments on the legalization of homebrewing.

I don't know what would happen to hop compounds when boiled for a long time, but you'll probably still get some bitterness from them.

You know what, you question got me curious about how it would taste at the end. =P

4694,2,,2015-11-18T08:31:15.283,4,,"Strange question, but here goes: No, on both.

Explanation: 
To make a beer strong requires a LOT of ingredients and of these the ones that provide sugars for the yeast are most important. The large volume of ingredients means that the beer will (usually) have complex malt flavours.

Mashing:
We immediately run into a problem: You can only get so much sugar out of malt. So you use all sorts of tricks to get the most out of your malt.

Boiling:
To increase the sugar content the brewers add sugars to the wort. Next problem: too much sugar and the beer does not taste very good and fermentation problems are a possible problem. (Sugars can also be added to the fermentation). Another trick is to concentrate the wort by boiling for a longer period. The water evaporates, but the sugars and other ingredients stay in the wort. Note that a large amount of hops is required to balance all the sugars.

Fermentation: High gravity beers are notoriously difficult to ferment. The biggest problem is that the alcohol in the beer becomes so much that it poisons the yeast. So, you need a yeast that is ""strong"" enough to work in these harsh conditions. You will often find that brewers will mix strains, starting with a lager, then going to ale, then to champagne or wine yeast. Most ""normal"" yeasts will (with help) get you a product of 15-20% ABV. Stronger yeasts can go higher than 20%, but not much further.

Post Fermentation:
Lest assume that you ended with a naturally fermented product of 20%. Fermentation is complete and your yeast is dead. The alcohol kills any other yeast that you add. What next? Ice concentration! This process is seen as a form of distilling. You put your fermenter in a freezer and scoop out the ice crystals. As water freezes before alcohol, the alcohol in the beer increases. Stronger beer! But the penalty is that you use a lot of flavour and aroma during this process.

The final product: A boozy, typically malty, bready, product, usually on the sweeter side. The body tends to be heavy. Hops is usually low to none, unless the beer was dry-hopped post concentration.

Here is a list of the strongest beers:

However; boiling wort is ""required"" to make beer and excessive boiling is used in some styles to give it extra flavours and colours or to make the resulting beer stronger.

And be careful which Guinness you use because there are a number of them out there with different ""strengths"".  If the densities are too close, they'll mix together.  

A good starting point in selecting interesting combinations is to look at the densities across different styles.  Pick two that are widely different and find bottles of each.  For instance, if you take a bottle of a kriek (red-looking fruit lambic), it would probably float nicely on most other beers, but you'd want to pick a nice, dark beer to show off the contrast (plus, if you used a kriek (cherry) or frambois (raspberry), pairing it with a porter or stout that has nice chocolate tones would taste very nice).  Likewise, just about anything would float on a bock or a strong scotch ale like a ""wee heavy"".

I loved Samuel Smith's, Old Peculiar, Bass Ale, and others.  I expanded from there and sought out other beers and ales that were not your ordinary North American Lagers and found many I liked.  I quickly discovered homebrewing while perusing a used bookstore.  This was way before it was popular here and way before 'Craft Brewing' was a term that people knew.  I started to make my own.  Now I really like beer. However I still don't really like most of the big-brand beers.  And I don't drink beer as a thirst quencher.  But if someone offers me a beer - I am no snob and say yes.

As far as DNA or genetically based dislikes.  I don't think there is a 'beer' gene.  There may, however be genes that make people dislike, or at least avoid certain tastes or aromas, or perceive these in different ways. These could then translate to dislikes of beer.  However, there are so many types of beers that this is probably very unlikely.  It would at least it's unlikely that beer would be the only thing that would be affected by this inheritance.

I think a dislike of beer can be overcome.  Many people have notions of beer that are not really true.  A friend said she hated dark beer because it was too bitter.  I explained that this was not really true (that all dark beer is very bitter). So, I brought over some examples that were not bitter, but chocolaty, sweet, roasty, etc.  She now loves dark beers (most are actually not very bitter).  With some people it is really difficult to overcome these dislikes however.  But at least, in my opinion, most of these dislikes are learned.

4707,2,,2015-12-01T01:56:47.860,1,,"Some things to consider:

If you don't tap a beer every so often, the beer that is left in regular beer faucets can dry out and lock the tap shut.  I suggest a perlick faucet as it seals without drying out.  I've used mine for years without any ""sticky tap"" problems.

If you are going to have a tower on top of the fridge, the beer line in the tower will warm up to the ambient room temperature.  This means that the first part of the first pour of the night will be very foamy as the pressure is different in the warm tower.  Some way of insulating the tower or circulating the air inside the tower will ensure the quality of the beer in the line.

When cutting the top of the fridge, be very careful to avoid damaging the cooling lines (if there are any in the top) as that will destroy the cooling ability on that wall of the refrigerator.

If you're keeping it in the garage, you may want to consider some way of sealing the tap when you're done for the night.  A plug will prevent flies or ants from enjoying your beer while you're out.  A lock will prevent any neighbors from doing the same.

Probably not as direct as a link to a conversion kit, but hopefully this will help you decide.

The best advice I've ever heard on sour beers is from the tour at New Belgium Brewery:   Take a sip and think for a few seconds about what the beer is trying to tell you then take another sip.  If the second was better than the first, take a third.  If the third was better than the second then keep going.

  On most flights the cabin altitude will be between 6,000 and 8,000 ft.
  (1,828m and 2,438m) even though the aircraft is flying at much higher
  altitudes. In other words, on most flights, it is as if you are on top
  of a hill or small mountain. This imposes two stresses on the body:
  less oxygen; and, expansion of gases in the body cavities.


The reason for feeling drunk more quickly is due to the lack of oxygen presented by the lack of pressure. Lack of oxygen, according to this source, gives rise to the following symptoms and comes to the same conclusion:


  There are various symptoms, including dizziness, lightheadedness,
  fatigue, drowsiness, weakness, nausea, unsteady gait, and a headache.

Hops were first used to flavor beer around 1000 A.D., starting in Germany.  Until this time beer was flavored with a mix of herbs and spices called ""gruit"" which was taxed (generally by either the government or the Roman Catholic Church) and in many cases required by law, so when hops did appear, they appears in regions where the church had less control.  

Hops didn't make their way to England until around 1500 A.D., and weren't universally used until around the year 1600.   Since Henry VIII reigned from 1509 until 1547, it would have been early in the introduction of hops to the region, and it is certainly within the realm of possibility that he may have outlawed them as a threat to the tax revenue stream provided by the sale of gruit.   Eventually though, demand for hops won out, and Henry's own wars with the Catholic Church may have weakened the ability to gruit rights-holders to continue to monopolize the market, and as I mentioned, by fifty years after Henry's death, hops ultimately won the war.

Then, maybe the bitterness or just the flavour. The people may be sensitive to bitterness, or just really do not like the taste of (that) beer.

You have to determine why the person reacts that way. If it is the malt, then get them a gluten free beer, if it is alcohol, then try an alcohol free beer, or just a cold drink, if it is the bitterness, then get a beer that is less bitter, if it is the flavour, then get a beer with a different flavour (fruit beer or a different style of beer that has other prominent flavours).

Pilsner - High sided flute to concentrate the hop aroma and show off the high carbonation of Pilsners.
Weissbeir - German wheat beers are usually served in tall glasses to show off the cloudy beer and also the creamy tall head of foam.

4757,2,,2016-01-06T11:44:27.420,4,,"It might sound snobbish to be peckish about the type of glass but the glass does influence the taste of the beer. 

Some things are:
 - the thickness of the glass. A thin glass invites to a more delicate way of drinking, a really thick glass would let you expect a sturdier beer.
 - the surface compared to the volume of beer. A big surface gives a change to let of more aroma's but I would think you also need a little more foam.
 - the capacity to keep the aroma's. As pointed out by Rube. Think of a cognac glass versus a vase. Some glasses also take in you nose deeper than others.
 - the way the beer flows. The shape of the glass how quickly you can drink it without spilling. Think of kwak, you HAVE to drink the last very carefully.

So to answer your question: there are many factors how the glass influences how you taste a beer. What's best is very subjective. You could at first stick to the opinion of the brewer, what he finds the best glass for it. If you like the taste with an other glass better, use that. I would not approach this as a hard science. Brewers might choose a specific glass to ""stand out"".

4759,2,,2016-01-06T16:27:55.250,7,,"Question one: how does bottled beer differ from draught beer?
This varies from beer to beer, and should be handled on a beer-to-beer basis. Sometimes beer in the bottle is pasteurized, while the keg is not. Sometimes one or the other is filtered, while the other is not. The gas content can also differ, since this is adjustable in draught systems but not with bottles.

In some cases, such as when yeast content is very important for the flavor profile of a beer, like German Hefeweizen, how much yeast you get in your glass has a big impact on the drinking experience. When drinking from the bottle, you can make sure that you get all of the yeast from the bottom of the bottle into your glass by agitating the last few ounces of beer, but this isn't possible with a keg. 
Kegged versions of these beers still have yeast in them, but you're not getting that perfect ratio in every glass. In my two years as a beer enthusiast living in Germany, these beers are almost always served from the bottle, and every bar or bartender has their preferred method for getting all the yeast out of a bottle.

Question two: What is done to bottled beer to prolong its shelf life?
This also differs from beer to beer. Some imports are pasteurized in the bottle, some others, namely MillerCoors products, use proprietary hop derivatives like Tetrahop to keep hop flavor while minimizing hop oils' susceptibility to producing off-flavors due to light exposure. This isn't a bad or unnatural thing, and I hope this becomes more widespread, because skunked, lightstruck beer is awful. (see this interview) This, however, is also present in kegged beer, as it has other beneficial properties like increased head retention.
Sometimes, though, nothing is done beyond packaging, like Sierra Nevada's transition from twist-off to pry-off caps a few years ago to combat leaking, infection, and oxidation. Brookston Beer Blog 2007

Question three: Why is draught so much better?
Very, very subjective, and you may want to clarify or qualify this in the future. Is good draught beer better than old, skunked bottled beer? Yes. Is good bottled beer better than flat draught beer poured through dirty lines? Also yes. Each has its pros and cons when it comes to service and storage.

I would venture to say that much of draught beer's appeal comes from it being special- you typically have to go somewhere else to get it in a way that's not usually available to the home user, like how the theater experience differs from the home movie experience. Yes, you can get bottled beer in bars, too, but it's still a more ""normal"" format. In terms of taste over experience, though, I don't know that you could say for sure without some sort of blind tasting with lots of variables (age, glass type, line cleanliness, CO2 pressure) controlled for. Even then, what does it for the tasters might not do it for you.

Sucking fluid trough the straw requires a lower than ambient pressure in the lungs and mouth. This lower pressure causes more of the alcohol to evaporate, this alcohol is absorbed by the lungs again increasing alcohol absorption.

While drinking with a straw will get you drunk faster it will not necessarily get you more drunk as this is mostly just related to the amount of consumed alcohol.

Fortunately for us today, the monasteries in the beer-loving Belgium survived (or in cases like that of the Rochefort Abbey, were restored).

Today, the ""Authentic Trappist Product"" logo, which defines a ""real"" Trappist beer, is owned by the International Trappist Association, an organization founded in 1997. The founding members include six abbeys from Belgium, one from the Netherlands, and one from Germany (which doesn't produce beer). It is only in very recent years that the ITA has expanded to recognize breweries aside from the original 7, the first ""new"" one being Stift Engelszell from Austria in 2012.

The Trappists were founded in 1664 as a branch of the Benedictine Order at the La Trappe Abbey. The abbot of La Trappe has a greater authority of jurisdiction than the other trappist abbots. Under canon law this is permitted because La Trappe is the motherhouse of the Trappist Order. 

The history of the Trappist Foundation in 1997 is of a totally different perspective. Originally only La Trappe Abbey could grant the title of the label to those Trappist breweries which could safeguard the integrity of the Order. All other monasteries which could not or would not abide to the conditions to be met, would not be granted the Trappist Label. 

Since 2012, four other Trappist monasteries have been added to the list, including St. Joseph's Abbey in Massachusetts, United States.

The three basic rules for granting the label are:


The beer must be brewed within the monastery, by the monks or at least under the supervision of the monks.
The making of ales should be of a secondary importance to the monastery and should be seen as a witness of monastic life.
Any profits from the brewery are to be use to help sustain the monks in their life of prayer. Any extra income is to be given to some sort of charity.


There seems to be no other Trappist Abbeys that were producing beer at the time the label was founded. Since abbeys are independent of one another, sources of revenue are not limited to the brewing of ales. Some abbeys made vestments, while other distilled products such as kirsch, as was the case at Fontgombault Abbey from 1849-1905. Fontgombault Abbey (Wikipedia)

One can also order it online using the same criteria. Here is an example for Alberta.

If you are fortunate enough to be able to cross the border you will have little trouble finding Grimbergen in the US. Normally would pay duty upon returning to Canada, but in my experience here in BC is that if your bottle of wine is valued less than $10.00 or you are bringing back only a six-pack of beer or cider, you will not pay anything.

Hops also add a lot in particular aroma. Since so much of tasting depends on the nose aroma comes of as flavour too. By boiling hops most of the aroma disappears and your left with only bitterness. By boiling hops for a shorter time, or not at all you can add more aroma. Brewers often talks about bittering vs aroma hops. Hops bitterness and aroma contribution depends on the variety of hops used. Hops growers are constantly coming up with new types of hops. 

Malt, grain having been processed, also add flavour. Though most malt come from the same type of grain, barley, it can be processed/malted in many different ways giving a different flavour. When mashing (getting the sugar out of the malt and into the liquid) you can adjust the flavour by temperature. At high temperature (68c) you get almost only unfermentable sugar, which will give you a sweet result, while mashing at 64 will give you fermentable sugar and therefore a dry product. 

Water does not add so much to the flavour in it self as it helps other parts of the recipe add a certain flavour. PH and content of minerals have a huge impact on mashing and fermentation.

Examples are: Raimundos, Sepultura (which is a brazilian hardcore band well-known around the world) and Paralamas do Sucesso, bands which have a beer with their names produced by Bamberg Brewery, a microbrewery of São Paulo state dedicated exclusively to german styles.

4823,2,,2016-02-11T14:11:44.393,1,,"In addition to blending different beers (like, blending an stout with an IPA, getting something like a black IPA), it's important to mention that almost all barrel aged beers are blends, because of the very nature of barrel aging.

When I mention barrel aged beers, I'm not just referring to the recent barrel aged styles which have been created by the american craft beer scene, but also to more traditional ones like the Belgian ones: lambic, flanders red and oud bruin.

Blending is crucial to beverages aged on barrels (even whisky or wine), because you never get a regular result from them. It depends heavily on the barrel itself (remember, it's wood, a biological element), the storage conditions of each of them (temperature, for example, which varies depending on the position of it in the warehouse) and some other random factors. So, the only way to achieve a consistent and reproducible product is blending, trying to fuse all those different characteristics in the right proportion, giving you an expected final product. In this process, is even common having to dump some barrels, which will not make it on the final proportion (maybe, let's say, you have too many very sour barrels, and you don't want your beer to be so that sour).

Additionally, another common practice is to blend aged beer with the young (not aged) version of it. Beers like Rodenbach, for example, are like this (Rodenbach Grand Cru has 2/3 of aged beer with 1/3 of fresh beer). Dogfish's Burton Barton is a blend of wood-aged and fresh IPA, as well.

So, blending beer is not exactly a new thing. I understand that your question was about blending different styles of beers, which is still less common, probably because the brewers will try to do that from the beginning, with the ingredients, but is not an heresy. We should try doing this more often, I dare to say.

4828,2,,2016-02-13T20:45:15.327,4,,"TLDR answer: Unfornately, no.
From my own experience, this varies a lot from company to company. It also depends on country's legislation or even the state, when it comes to USA. As far as I know, expiring dates for beers are even not obligatory by law in many american states.
Besides that, some breweries inform the bottling date, others the expiration date, which is less useful, because if you are a experienced drinker you know how old (or not) you want your beer to be, despite what the producer has estimated for it. So, in those cases, first you need to figure out the given shelf-life of it, and count backwards, to know when it was bottled. Pretty messy. I age beers and I'm quite used to it.
So, in general, when that information is not clear, your best (and maybe only) friend is the web - the brewery's website or forums.
For example, Anchor Brewery has a very particular (and weird) code standard for bottling date, but it is well explained on their website.

The date code currently being used by Anchor Brewing Company (post-October 1991) replaces the clock-face that used to show the bottling month as one of 12 small notches around the main label. A three character code is now included on the new back label of the bottle. The code works like this:
The first character is always numeric and represents the last digit of the year. The second character is always alpha and represents the month by using the first letter of the month unless that letter has already been used:
January: J, February: F, March: M, April: A, May: Y, June: U, July: L,  August: G, September: S, October: O, November: N, December: D
The third character in the code is either alpha or numeric and tells the day of the month. The first 26 days are represented by the alphabet with the remaining days listed as:
27th through 29th = 7 through 9, 30th = 3, 31st = 1
An example of a date code would be: January 20, 2012 = 2JT

Not all breweries are so transparent like that, though. I have had a lot of trouble trying to figure out bottling date of some European beers, specially from some small, old breweries. Some american ones just won't tell anything about it as well, even on bottles.

They make a variety of beers and I believe that all of them are certified Kosher by the KSA.

http://www.shmaltzbrewing.com/HEBREW/home.html

EDIT: After some more research, it's a little hard to confirm whether all their beers are truly kosher. The wikipedia article says that they are, and there are a couple different news articles about them claiming that they are, but the KSA page has no products listed for the company.

It does seem like some of the promotional materials for the beers have the KSA label, like the one for Chanukah beer. But many of them are harder to tell. I have been under the impression that all their beers were Kosher, but it might be worth asking the company for more information.

4833,2,,2016-02-17T22:06:33.417,1,,"While I can't point you to a calculator on beer gas mixture I can point you to this Fact sheet from the Brewers Association.

The key to balance a tap system is figuring out the opposing pressures. The keg to tap resistance must be matched by the gas tank push pressure. The gas pressure puts in a little CO2, the liquid line squeezes a little out. However, in long draw setups where the draft line has a lot of resistance the push pressure would have be so high that a lot more CO2 would be dissolved into the beer.  The amount of CO2 squeezed out would cause very foamy beer. How to solve this?  Mix in some Nitrogen.

Basically, the Nitrogen will never blend into the beer.  It is used as an inert gas to maintain the pressure in long draw lines.  Any change in carbonation would come from the mix ratio.  If the mix is too low in CO2, as the keg empties the beer will go flat since not enough CO2 is being forced in.  If the mix is too high in CO2 then the beer would gain carbonation from the beer gas.

Your ratio of 30% CO2 / 70% N is more suited to a Nitro tap setup.  Traditional nitro beers have an original carbonation level of around 1-1.5 volumes of CO2.  The amount of CO2 needed to maintain this carbonation level is minimal PLUS the faucets that pour these beers have an extra plate that restricts the flow even more, forcing almost all gas out of the beer.  Without that specialized faucet, the beer coming out would just be flat with maybe a few sad bubbles of CO2 but no thick head of foam that you'd expect.

Where this conception comes from is that almost everyone who has their first beer drinks some of the worst beer out there, usually in their teens because they're surrounded by masses of other people who also don't know anything about alcohol. 

So their first impression of beer is either a Heineken, Budweiser, Canadian, Guinness, etc, and that's what they decide beer is like. People who want to get drunk continue drinking it and eventually acclimatize to it, and people who really don't like generics end up switching to sweeter alternatives.

The thing about beer though is that there is a huge variation in flavours and styles. To try a Budweiser and then say ""I don't like beer"" is really saying ""I don't like Budweiser"". It's an opinion that arises out of the ignorance of what's available to the consumer.

And so I'd argue that if almost anyone wanted to make an honest attempt to find a beer they liked, they would eventually find something under the enormous 'beer' label that they enjoyed. I've just convinced way too many people who thought they didn't like beer to start drinking it to believe it's at all hereditary. Psychological? Maybe. Genetic? No.

4841,2,,2016-02-19T02:51:08.687,2,,"That's a very broad question, and hard to answer.

Very early on, hops weren't well known, and beer was made without hops; this likely would have caused the beer to be sweeter than it is today. Hops were known and added to beer relatively early in the Middle Ages, though.

Today, in my opinion, the key differences are variety and technology. Not only do we have a greater variety in styles, but we have more varieties of hops, malts, and different yeasts. These create wildly different flavor profiles unheard of centuries ago. Technology has allowed us to create more consistency in beers, as well as increasing variety indirectly through different techniques used in brewing.

4843,2,,2016-02-19T17:09:15.807,7,,"Not only has variety improved, but so has the technology and agronomy of brewing.

Malt variety, yield, and efficiency


Crop science has increased the size of barley kernels and the amount of starches available to convert to sugar.  The common grain at the time was 6-row malt, today the most common brewing barley is 2-row. 
Understanding of the malting process has drastically improved. Today we understand how to get perfectly malted barley. Historically the malt would have been over or under modified.  Under modified would have lots of unconverted starch which would leave a hazy beer that tasted rather bready. Over modified malt would would have no starch, but less sugar than possible so the resulting beer may lack body.
Kiln dryers allow for greater variety of malt. By controlling the heat cycle, the same variety of barley can make different malt.  Drying the grain in medieval times consisted of heating it over a fire.  Fire dried grains would have a smokey flavor that would be present in the beer.  The traditional Scottish Ale uses malt that has been dried over a fire where the fuel is peat, which is a very distinct smoke flavor.  The fire also was not nearly as exact or even as a modern kiln so some kernels would be burnt and other may be under cooked, so to speak. 


Water


Needless to say, but water purity is drastcally better today than in the 6th-15th centuries.  Because the brewing process boils the water, the beer was safer to drink than the water. Hence the patron saint of brewers said ""Drink beer, not water.""
Dissolved mineral content of water and pH control.  Medieval brewers had the water that they had.  Today, a brewer can start with distilled water and add whatever minerals they desire to change the flavor profile and pH of the mash.  The water pH can effect the mash efficiency and fermentation profile of the beer.  This lack of water control lead to specific styles coming from specific areas. I.E. Burton upon Trent is known for pale ales, Pilsen for golden pilsners, Munich for malty lagers.Some water source mineral content.


Hops


Ancient beers were not hoppy. Hops were not used extensively in beer until about the 12th century and were not cultivated en mass until about the 13th century.  Most beers older than that were bittered with Gruit..
The hops that were used were not high in bittering acids.  The oldest common hop varieties are the Noble hops.  Just like today, costs of ingredients was a major factor in brewing.  Making a really hoppy beer was prohibitively expensive.  Just compare an English IPA brewed from old recipes vs. an American IPA.   


Yeast and Microbiology


This is where modern technology really helps out.  Louis Pasteur discovered yeast in 1857. Up until that time, the changing of sugar into alcohol was considered magic or an act of god.  It was understood that the foam on top of a fermenting wort could be passed around to other vats of wort to start the process (Krausening). Others would transfer Magic Sticks from batch to batch to start fermentation.
There are other microorganisms that can inhabit beer. Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus to name a few.  These can cause a sour, acidic flavor in beer.  Some ancient breweries would just let the cold night air in through an open window in order to cool the freshly boiled wort, exposing the warm sugar solution to whatever might land on it.  


Technology


Thermometers - The temperature of the mash can affect the fermentabilty of the wort. The temperature of the malting and drying affect the sugar content of malted barley.
Chemical cleaners - All of the brewing equipment is sanitary. Modern living through chemistry.
Food storage/availability - I can get whatever ingredients I want, whenever I need them.
Refrigeration - I can cool the wort in controlled conditions. Beer can travel farther. I can ferment at optimal yeast temperature.
More than can possibly be named...


The Result?


Ancient beers would be sweeter and thicker than today's thanks to less fermentable sugars in the wort due to inconsistencies in the brewing process, and inconsistencies in the malting process and poor yeast/microorganism control.  The alcohol content would be lower as well.
Ancient beers would not be hoppy.
Ancient beers would have to be drunk quickly before they spoiled.  The other bugs in the beer would turn the beer bad after a few weeks.  This also prevented the beer from traveling very from from the brewery.
Ancient beers could vary greatly, batch to batch.  The brewers of the times were very skilled with what they could work with, but they were constrained by what ingredients they could use, whether by law or availability.  Flavor can be affected by fermentation temperature, so a hot day in December could ruin my beer.
Ancient beers were dependent on the season. When was the grain harvested? When is it cool enough to ferment?

What I believe you're doing is creating a slightly more sour IPA. With more dissolved CO2 in the beer, you're creating slight amounts of carbonic acid, and acids make things a bit more sour. Seems like a pretty cool variant of an IPA, actually.

4868,2,,2016-02-25T20:16:07.823,7,,"Answer to the easiest part of the question: Yes, IPAs (India Pale Ales) are beers.

Unfortunately, there isn't a clear and concise answer to the rest of you question. 

Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that by ""regular beer"", you mean Budweiser. Budweiser sits at 5% ABV. IPAs are often in the 5-7% ABV range, so let's call an ""average"" IPA 6%. You will feel the alcohol substantially more quickly in the 6% IPA than in the 5% Budweiser.

Lifehacker has a nice article that explains this phenomenon well, but it boils down to the rate at which your body can process alcohol. Suppose that 1% ABV corresponded to 1 ""alcohol unit."" If, for example, your body could process 4.5 alcohol units/hour, after 6 pints of a 5% ABV beer (1/hr), you'd have 3 alcohol units left in your body [(5.0-4.5)*6]. However, you'd reach the same mark after only 2 beers (1/hr) of a 6% ABV beer [(6-4.5)*2].

TL;DR Version: It probably has to do with the beer's ABV you were drinking.

Side note: There is a lot of variability in strength within any given style. If you like IPAs, you should check out Session IPAs - They are IPAs designed to be lower in ABV than the average IPA, so you can drink more of them in a drinking ""session.""

  Brewing is the production of beer by steeping a starch source (commonly cereal grains, the most popular of which is barley) in water and fermenting the resulting sweet liquid with yeast. It may be done in a brewery by a commercial brewer, at home by a homebrewer, or by a variety of traditional methods such as communally by the indigenous peoples in Brazil when making cauim. Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that emerging civilizations, including ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, brewed beer. Since the nineteenth century the brewing industry has been part of most western economies.
  
  The basic ingredients of beer are water and a fermentable starch source such as malted barley. Most beer is fermented with a brewer's yeast and flavoured with hops. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava. Secondary sources (adjuncts), such as maize (corn), rice, or sugar, may also be used, sometimes to reduce cost, or to add a feature, such as adding wheat to aid in retaining the foamy head of the beer. The most common starch source is ground cereal or ""grist"" - the proportion of the starch or cereal ingredients in a beer recipe may be called grist, grain bill, or simply mash ingredients.
  
  Steps in the brewing process include malting, milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging. There are three main fermentation methods, warm, cool and spontaneous. Fermentation may take place in an open or closed fermenting vessel; a secondary fermentation may also occur in the cask or bottle. There are several additional brewing methods, such as Burtonisation, barrel-ageing, double dropping, and Yorkshire Square.

Personally, two of my favorite pairings are hoppy IPAs with spicy food, and imperial stouts with desserts (especially if they are chocolate-based). IPAs complement the spice and help cut the heat of the spicy food. And the dark roastiness of the imperial stouts really complements the sweetness of dessert.

The various laws are being used to differentiate between Ale and Beer.  Ale being made with a selection of herbs known as a ""gruit"" - that must not contain hops.  Whereas beer was flavoured with hops (and possibly other herbs).  The generic use of hops was never banned[2], but the use of hops in ale was controlled.

First, we're going to eliminate ""novel"" options for cooling, like liquid nitrogen and fire extinguishers, and limit ourselves to ways we can cool bottles every day in the freezer.  

What we need to maximize here is thermal conductivity.  Since the goal here is homeostasis, we need to move heat out of the bottle and into the surrounding medium as quickly as possible.  And air, as it turns out, is a pretty lousy conductor.  So that makes your first friend most wrong.  Keeping the bottle dry will cool it eventually, but quite slowly.   However, ice isn't that much better.  Because there's a lot of air still touching the bottle when it's in ice.  It'll cool it better, but it's certainly still not the best option.  

The best option, it turns out, is an ice water mixture, with a healthy dose of salt to help keep the water liquid, even below 0 degrees Celsius.  Water happens to be an excellent conductor, and with ice to keep it cold and salt to keep it liquid, can draw heat out of bottles faster than any other non-exotic method, by a significant margin.

4926,2,,2016-04-07T00:44:00.157,8,,"Generally - yes.

A large part of the flavour of the beer comes from esters produced by the yeast during fermentation.  There are many different varieties of yeast, and each has a differing set of esters it produces.

The problem arises in that as temperatures increase the yeast ferments and grows much more rapidly, and can produce different and/or too many esters, in addition to fusel alcohols.

Most packs of brewer's ale yeasts will have a temperature range on the back, say something like 18-25°C{1}.  However, unless one is brewing a beer style that warrants it (like a ""Saison"") the general rule is to keep the beer fermenting below 20°C.  Ideally, 18-19°C is best.  (You don't want to go too low either, at &lt; 15°C, ale yeast may go dormant - but that's another answer.)

So, what can you do?


Brew only in winter.
Find a spot in your house, a cave, whatever that maintains this temperature.
Immerse your fermenter in a larger vessel of water:


Find a vessel significantly larger than your fermenter.  Bathtub, laundry sink, plastic barrel, etc.
Put your fermenter inside this, fill the space with water.  Drape a cloth, towel, t-shirt, over the fermenter such that it wicks-up the water.  This cools by evaporation.  
Add blocks of ice a few times a day, as necessary.

Modify an old freezer (or 'fridge) with a temperature controller:


A device like an STC-1000 allows one to simply set the temperature wanted inside the 'fridge and it monitors and adjusts the temperature by turning the electricity on and off.
Some variants of these have the controller mounted in a box with a pair of domestic sockets, so the 'fridge doesn't need to be modified, just plugged in. (the temperature probe still has to go inside though).



I personally brew in a hot climate (some Autumn &amp; Spring, and most Summer days are > 30°C), and have used all these methods with varying levels of success.  They are ordered from least-successful to most-successful.

{1} Just because the yeast pack says it's OK at 25°C, doesn't mean it produces good beer at this temperature.  I expect some people will disagree with me on this. Ultimately it's a matter of preference, and I think keeping fermentation temperatures &lt; 20°C is good advice for a beginner.

The ""Imperial"" part of the name though, has some interesting history.

During the 1698-1700's ""Porter"" beer was exported from England to the court of Russia.  However during initial shipment, the long journey ruined the beer.  Barklay's Brewery in London significantly increased both the alcohol and hops in the beer to help it prevent spoilage during the trip.  This beer became known as ""Russian Imperial Stout"".

The short answer is approximately 3-5 days, but it all depends on the type of wine. There are a number of factors at play when it comes to the life of wine, after it has been opened.  

These include acetic acid bacteria that consumes the alcohol in wine and metabolizes it into acetic acid and acetaldehyde. This causes the wine to have a sharp, vinegar-like smell.  Additionally, the alcohol can oxidize, causing a nutty, bruised fruit taste, that robs the wine of fresh, fruity flavors. These are both chemical reactions, and so the lower the temperature you keep a wine at, the slower this will happen.

Please see link for full reference and detailed breakdown of How long wine lasts after opening: How Long Does an Open Bottle of Wine Last?

4940,2,,2016-04-07T22:36:13.537,6,,"First, we have to understand why we age whiskey in the first place.  It's primarily to extract compounds from the wood of the barrels (and any previous contents) so that they can add flavor and complexity to the final product.  

From there, there are several factors that determine how long a typical aging period might be.  


If the wood in the barrels is new, or has been previously used.   Bourbon, which is typically aged as few as 4 years is aged in casks of new wood, meaning there are more compounds in the wood to be extracted, and they can be extracted more quickly.  Scotch, on the other hand, which is often aged from 10-25 years, is aged in previously used barrels, so it takes longer to extract the desired level of flavoring compounds.  
How much flavor you want the wood to add to the finished product.  A Rye, aged for 10 years, is going to have a lot more oak than you would want in say, an Anejo Tequila, which will often be aged for just a year or two.  
The type of wood can have an impact as well.  Most whiskeys are aged in American or French oak, but if other woods are used, a tighter grain, or different wood chemistry can mean that you need more time in the barrel to the get the flavors that you want.

Contrary to popular belief tequila doest always give you the craziest hang over, at least not the newer tequilas since they are better quality, that is, if you are drinking real tequila. Real tequila is made from the agave plant and depending on the region grown in Mexico ( south, north) will have a slight different taste.

There is the silver, gold or aged and extra aged, all have distinct flavors and undertones. Here is a good link with some tequila information and history also for tasting.
So if the bottle says mixed or mixto then it's for mixing and should not be drank alone unless you want to feel like a truck hit you the next day.

Some people reach for the cheap bottle that's in the door of the fridge when making a braise, where the wine will cook for a long time.
Others use the type of wine you’d serve with dinner to make the dish. Even better, unless you’re pouring something rare or expensive, buy an extra bottle and cook with it. When you’re cooking with red wine, watch out for tannins. When concentrated in reduction sauces, they can become harsh. Fortunately, proteins found in meat and dairy declaw tannins like milk does tea.
Wines contains sugars, acids, and tannins, and each of these will show up on the plate. Subtle characteristics, by contrast, normally disappear with cooking. To maintain balance, check your recipe for acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar and cut back to make room for the acid in the wine. This is especially crucial when cooking with white wine. For delicate fish or vegetables, a dry non-oaked wine works best. If your recipe is packed with onions, carrots and tomatoes, there will be plenty of sugars in the pot, so cooking with a fuller-bodied, less dry red or white wine can integrate perfectly.
For deeper flavors, experiment with fortified wines like Port, Sherry, Madeira and Marsala. Michael Schachner offers some helpful tips and recipes on cooking with fortified wine in this piece.
Cook with a wine you would drink. Do not use a wine to cook if you would never drink it in a glass or serve it with food.
• Start with a basic red or white wine. An example of a good white to cook with is Sauvignon Blanc. Try Chianti or Cabernet Sauvignon for a red.
• Avoid using wines that are labeled &quot;cooking wines.&quot; These wines contain a lot of salt and other additives and you would never drink them in a glass.

This means that an age statement can lend itself to a lot of profitability, or lack thereof.

By excluding age statements that allows distillers to put out product faster, and not have to correlate their pricing model with age necessarily.

The cons to a distiller would be very minimal as the average consumer doesn't think too much about this type of thing, knowledge about whisky is typically very low. The only real con is to a consumer that may be getting fleeced by marketing tactics.

Guinness has a few beers, one of their biggest beers is a Foreign Extra Stout. This is brewed in various counties. This is a higher ABV, roastier beer. I think it has double the ABV of a ""standard"" Guinness.

One other important fact is emotions. If I am sitting in the Guinness Brewery, looking out over Dublin, drinking a fresh, perfectly poured Guinness, I am in a very happy place. This happiness will affect my overall experience of the beer. If you take that same keg, keep it cool and fly it overnight to the US and taste it there, it will still be good, but it will not be as good, because you are missing the experience.

  The main reason to chill filter a whisky is actually purely cosmetic


Chill filtering is a process that makes sure that a whiskey won't go cloudy if water or ice is added to it.

It is mainly only done as people don't want to see a cloudy whiskey so it is done a a cosmetic touch to make the whiskey more appealing. 

Although if a whiskey is above 46% this process is not necessary as the alcohol level will stop the cloudiness from happening. 

It is causing a bit of bother with whiskey distillers as people want a natural organic whiskey so they don't want it to go through the process of chill filtering but they also want a nice clear whiskey.

You can mull white wine but most people prefer a red. It needs to be inexpensive, obviously, but that doesn’t mean it should be undrinkable so don’t just chuck in the tail ends of bottles you may have hanging round the kitchen. And you don’t want a wine that’s too heavily oaked though that’s relatively unlikely if it’s cheap.

There’s a fair amount of inexpensive own-label Corbières I’ve noticed lately which would fit the bill perfectly or try a basic Portuguese red. Most recipes add water as well which brings down the cost and stops guests getting too plastered but adjust the amount to the strength of your wine.

Whole spices work better than ground ones otherwise you can get an unpleasant powdery sensation as you drink. Cinnamon is probably the most popular spice but you could also use cloves, cardamom (lightly crush a few pods) ginger and nutmeg. Some recommend star anise but use sparingly if you don't want your mulled wine to taste of aniseed. 

Most recipes call for sugar but you might want to add a little less than they suggest if your wine is particularly soft and fruity or if you add port.""

Chilling helps preserve and highlight fresh, fruity flavors of varieties like Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer. Chardonnay, on the other hand, though white, is more complex, is fermented and aged in oak barrels and thus is usually served at the upper end of the 'white' scale.

Full-bodied Cabernets should be served in the 70 degree range. The warmer temperature allows the complexity of intense reds to come through as they are swirled, sipped and savored. Lighter reds like chambourcin or merlot are less complex, so are best appreciated just slightly chilled.

In planning a festive gathering, consider several ways to attain the ""correct"" wine temperature. Refrigeration will decrease a bottle's temperature 4 to 5 degrees each half hour in the first 60-90 minutes. After that, temperatures will drop 2-3 degrees per half hour. Riesling should be chilled for 4 or 5 hours, a chardonnay for 1-2 hours, merlot for an hour and cabernets for a half hour or less.

Best Wines to Drink with Steak

Cabernet Sauvignon

""The king of red wines, Cabernet Sauvignon is often the number one choice for steak and wine pairings. Beef steak has lots of strong flavor from the meat itself and from smoke, marinade, sauce, or pepper, so it calls for choosing a wine that is also full-bodied. Cabernet Sauvignon’s robust fruit tastes and powerful flavors can stand up to most any steak. The tannins in Cabernet Sauvignon (coming mainly from the red skin of the grape)  and relatively high alcohol levels also help cut through the fat of the steak, making the wine taste smoother and less bitter… and the steak more flavorful.""

California Zinfandel

""Zinfandel has moderate tannins and high acidity, making it a fitting match with steaks that contain relatively good amounts of fat. Rib Eye, T-Bone or Porterhouse steaks are ideal partners for Zinfandel. A little less refined than  Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel has a characteristically bold grapey spiciness and thick richness on the pallet.""

Malbec 

""Malbec is an up and coming red wine that is definitely steak friendly. In fact, Malbec is the number one consumed red wine in Argentina where it’s considered the ideal wine to pair with beef.  Malbec is a versatile, rich and food-friendly red wine that may break with tradition but won’t break the bank. Check out Malbec wines from Argentina or Chile. You won’t be disappointed."" 

Other Good Red Wine Pairings with Steak

""The classic wine choices to pair with grilled steaks are big, bold red wines, especially California Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.  Merlot, Syrah (Shiraz from Australia), Sangiovese, Chianti and Pinot Noir are also good choices and will produce softer red wine and steak pairings, which you may prefer depending on the steak, the doneness you prefer and whatever else you are serving.""

Rosés, Blush Wine and Sparkling Wines

""Not to be forgotten, a crisp chilled Rosé wine or a bubbly Sparkling Wine (especially brut or rosé) is  almost always an enjoyable pairing with steak and other grilled fare. Just be sure to chill them in the refrigerator or on ice for several hours before serving. In fact, we recommend also chilling your red wines to avoid any “hot wine” influence on the taste of the steaks.""

If that was the case you would see carbonated fitness drinks for faster absorption.

There are studies that Champagne go to the head faster but it also has a lot of sugar. 

The more like causality is people that mix also just plain drink more.  

For me personally I like a shot (or two) of tequila first to get a buzz and then sip beer.  I am more likely to burn (most) of it off by the time I go to bed.  If you have a belly full of beer there is just a volume of liquid for the body to process and hard liquor on top is just more liquor.  You can get stupid with a few beer and then just get even way more stupid with shots as you are numb and the beer dilutes the alcohol so you don't feel the boom.  Shots early and you have more immediate and clear feedback you are over drinking. 

As for wine it has about the same effect on me and the alcohol difference is not that great.   I just don't like the taste of mixing them in one evening.

There are studies that higher percentage drinks are absorbed faster and it make sense as the body is processing a smaller volume for the alcohol.

Allowing wine to breathe has the following information on this subject:


  Allowing a wine to “breathe” is simply a process of exposing it to air for a period of time before serving. Exposing wine to air for a short time, or allowing it to oxidize, can help soften flavors and release aromas in a way similar to swirling the wine in your glass. Young red wines, especially those that are high in tannin, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, most Red Zinfandel, Bordeaux and many wines from the Rhône Valley, actually taste better with aeration because their tannins soften and the wine becomes less harsh. Another method of aerating a young, tannic red wine is to roughly decant it into another container, which exposes more of the wine's surface to air than simply removing the cork from the bottle. Uncorking a bottle and letting it sit undisturbed for period of time actually does very little to let the wine breathe as only a small percentage of the wine is in contact with air. A much better suggestion is aerating the wine in your glass or in a wine decanter. A decanter is defined as any vessel other than the original bottle that will hold the contents of the wine and allow for air to mix with the wine within. Usually, these are broad-bottomed glass or crystal containers. 
  
  Wine and air may have a negative effect on each other. To simplify, let us consider the following: 
  
  • Wine poured from a bottle into a glass and swirled is positive since the air mixture allows aromas to be displayed
  
  • Wine that has had a brief exposure to air is positive since it allows wine to breathe similar to stretching its legs after being cooped up in the bottle for so many years. This exposure has a positive effect on the wine after 25 to 30 minutes. Intensely tannic or younger reds may need up to a few hours. In general, most red and white wines will improve within the first half hour of opening the bottle. 
  
  • Extended exposure to air has a negative effect on the wine. After a day, the wine may obtain a vinegary smell or taste. Red wines and sweet white wines may last a little longer due to the natural preservatives of tannins and sugar. Refrigeration may be used to extend the life of white wine.

  Recall from above that the distinction between a mug and a stein is the hinged lid. This lid was originally conceived entirely as a sanitary measure. During the summers of the late 1400s, hoards of little flies frequently invaded Central Europe. By the early 1500s, several principalities in what is now Germany had passed laws requiring that all food and beverage containers be covered to protect consumers against these dirty insects. The common mug also had to be covered, and this was accomplished by adding a hinged lid with a thumblift. This ingenious invention was soon used to cover all German beverage containers while still allowing them to be used with one hand. - A Brief History of Beer Steins.

  Bourbon is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys. 


What make a bourbon a bourbon and not just an ordinary whiskey? The following is from Men's Journal: What, Exactly, Is the Difference Between Bourbon and Whiskey?


  The most popular form of American whiskey is bourbon, which has its own specific definition. 
  
  ""Bourbon needs to be produced in America and made from 51 percent corn, and whisky does not,"" says Maker's Mark Master Distiller Greg Davis. Bourbon also needs to be stored in new charred-oak barrels, whereas whiskey barrels do need to be oak but not new or charred. ""Lastly, to be called bourbon, the liquid needs to be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125."" For other whiskies the liquid must be distilled to no more than 190 proof. David notes that this isn't just common practice — ""it's actual bourbon law.""  
  
  What Makes a Bourbon: A Cheat Sheet
  
  •Must be made in the United States.
  
  •Must contain 51 percent corn.
  
  •Must be aged in new oak charred barrels.
  
  •Must be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125 proof.
  
  •Must be bottled at no less than 80 proof.
  
  •Must not contain any added flavoring, coloring or other additives.


The following is taken from Bourbon vs. Whiskey: 


  Somewhat like champagne isn't champagne unless it's made in Champagne, France, Bourbon is not actually ""Bourbon"" if it is made outside the USA, even though other whiskeys may adhere to the same recipe and distillation guidelines. 
  
  Tennessee Whiskey
  
  The legal requirements for whiskey to be called Tennessee Whiskey are that the whiskey should be: 
  
  -distilled in Tennessee 
  
  -made from at least 51% corn 
  
  -filtered through maple charcoal, and 
  
  -aged in new, charred oak barrels.
  
  This is the process by which Jack Daniel's is manufactured. The company is the largest whiskey producer in Tennessee and wields an outsize influence on liquor laws in the state; they lobbied the state legislature to create such stringent requirements for labeling Tennessee Whiskey. Other whiskey producers in the state, including UK-based Diageo that owns Tennessee's No. 2 whiskey distiller George Dickel, oppose these criteria and are lobbying to have them loosened. 


Some consider Tennessee Whiskey a Bourbon, while most do not. The fact remains that both Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel's are filtered through maple charcoal making them a different product. 

Addendum

What is scotch?


  The main difference between scotch and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour).


How long should Scotch Whisky be aged?


  It is not possible to lay down any precise age as being the best for a particular whisky. Generally speaking, Malt Whiskies require longer to mature fully than Grain Whiskies. UK and EU law insist that Scotch Whisky should be at least three years old. However, it is the practice of the trade to mature for substantially longer than the legal minimum.


What is rye?


  Rye whisky, like its name suggests, is a whiskey that is distilled from at least 51% rye. What is rye? Rye is a type of grass that is a member of the wheat tribe and closely related to barley. 


Canadian whisky is simply a rye whisky.

  bourbon : a straight whiskey distilled from a mash having at least 51 percent corn in addition to malt and rye.

You can usually see it in the color of the tequila as well, (though many cheap tequilas are pretty amber in color, but certainly not aged very long or well, so this isn't a great measure of how good it is).  Blancos, as their name suggests, tend to be clear in color, Anejos can have a very deep, nearly brown color.  Reposados start to show some of the characteristics of a good tequila (pepper, etc), and Anejos can be downright complex.

I suggest that you don't drink Blancos straight.  Reposados can be good sipped and are great mixed, and are a good price point.  Most Anejos would be wasted as a mixed drink, and should be sipped.

5033,2,,2016-05-26T13:16:45.730,4,,"The origins of the King's Shilling seems to have appeared about the time of the War of 1812, because of the need for recruitment was so necessary due to the fact that the English were already at war with France.


  Recruiting parties scoured the countryside and city streets for able-bodied soldiers. In his arsenal of weapons, the recruiting Sergeant offered any perspective recruit a bounty of over two month’s worth of wages to enlist. Some were offered the option to enlist for limited time of service, usually a 7-year term, and receive a smaller bounty, but most chose the other option: service for life. Calculating one’s options in life must have been difficult for the recruit in a noisy, smoke-filled Ale House after consuming a number of gills of rum, happily provided by a member of the recruiting party. While the recruiting prospect drank endless rounds from the punch bowl, his ears were filled with stories of an easy life as a soldier, quick promotion and how women to could not help but be drawn to a man in a red coat. 
  
  The members of a recruiting party were all quite motivated in convincing say a young weaver or labourer to join as each was paid handsomely for each recruit they brought before the army surgeon for inspection and got attested by a Justice of the Peace. If the potential recruit hesitated to enlisted, deception was applied. A recruiting sergeant recounted:
  
  …your last recourse was to get him drunk, and then slip a shilling in his pocket, get him home to your billet, and next morning swear he enlisted, bring all your party to prove it, get him persuaded to pass the doctor. Should he pass, you must try every means in your power to get him to drink, blow him up with a fine story, get him inveigled to the magistrates, in some shape or other, and get him attested; but by no means let him out of your hands.


Why the expression To Take The King's Shilling:


  The expression 'to take the king's shilling', meant to sign up to join the army. Rather like with the 'prest' money for the 'impressed' man, a bonus payment of a shilling was offered to tempt lowly paid workers to leave their trade (an average daily wage during the Napoleonic period was 2p (at 12p to a shilling, this represented six days wages in one go). Once the shilling had been accepted, it was almost impossible to leave the army.
  
  Since the army was not seen as an attractive career, recruiting sergeants often had to use less than honest methods to secure their 'prey', such as getting the recruitee drunk, slipping the shilling into his pocket and then hauling him before the magistrate the following morning (still hungover) to get him to accept the fact that he was now in the army. Sometimes the 'King's shilling' was hidden in the bottom of a pewter tankard (having drunk his pint, the unfortunate drinker found that he had unwittingly accepted the King's offer). As a result, some tankards were made with glass bottoms. Other recruits came from the courts, where a criminal's sentence could be commuted to service in the army - still the case (apparently) with the Blackwatch Regiment.
  
  In fact the bounty for joining the army was much larger than a shilling. New recruits received £23.17s.6d, but out of this they were obliged to buy their uniform - a not inconsiderable expence.

5035,2,,2016-05-26T18:05:14.683,9,,"""Bottom fermentation"" is one of the two main types of fermentation which take place during beer production; the other being ""top fermentation"". A third less common type would be spontaneous fermentation (a natural beer fermentation process taking place in the wild). Typically, only one fermentation process occurs during production (either bottom, top, or spontaneous fermentation). It basically describes what happens to the yeast during fermentation- some yeast float to the top of the liquid during fermentation, while some types of yeast sink to the bottom. Which type of fermentation takes place, depends on the type of yeast used in the process. So to answer your question, if it effects the type of drink (and taste), the answer is yes. It's not so much whether the yeast sink to the bottom or float to the top that affects the taste/style, but it is rather due to the type of yeast which determines what will happen to during fermentation (float to top/sink to bottom). For instance, lager strains of yeast typically float to the bottom. 

From Beeradvocate.com: 
""Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.""

""Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers.""

The only thing that really brings it down below my standard is if it's just not a quality beer.

In the same way generic lagers are an equivalent style and have a similar purpose, to be non-offensive and give people the 'beer' taste that they expect. So if you're drinking a Canadian, to a Bud, to a Sapporo you can expect them to be pretty similar.

The one additional thing I'll say, though, is that when beer falls into the realm of 'craft' you usually see a higher range of flavour within a style, than with generics, though. This is because the very purpose of a generic lager is not to stand out as to gain mass appeal.

Different lager styles definitely taste different, but the reason mainstream lagers all taste the same is because they're all pretty much the same style of lager- American lager, and are all probably brewed in a similar fashion (what those in the industry call ""macro brews"").

For instance, coors light, bud light, keystone light are all the same style of lager, just different brands of the same brew.

But to taste the difference between different styles of lagers, try a budweiser and compare it to a Pilsner Urquell (it's a Euro pilsner- another lager style). The bud will taste light, bready and slightly sweet, while the pilsner will taste crisp, somewhat floral, and slightly bitter on the finish (and definitely way better imho).

Since craft beers are made in small batches with brewmasters experimenting with different flavours through use of various hops (flavouring agents), I'd recommend trying craft lagers if you want to experience the difference lager styles and flavours within a style. A brooklyn lager definitely tastes different/better than a Budweiser, even though they're both of the American Lager style.

  If you’re confused, don’t be angry. Clearly the U.S. government is struggling with the issue as much as you are. Today’s science is capable of measuring imperfections in a spirit. So rather than insisting that 190 proof is an adequate minimum to guarantee quality in vodka, other metrics might have been considered in the TTB’s rule-making. For instance, some successful brands add sugar or glycerin to their vodkas to “smooth” them out. Never mind that these spirits throw any standard cocktail recipe completely out of balance. The larger question is: why do they need to add these softeners? What are they covering up? If they focused upon good raw ingredients and clean distillation they could achieve the same result. But perhaps that’s asking too much; it always comes back to economics.
  
  Other countries are demanding that producers note upon the label any additions such as sugar or glycerin; the TTB hasn’t wised up yet. It will probably be a while before those additives are visible on the vodka labels, but until then, taste the stuff yourself. If it tastes sweet, it probably is, and you may want to alter any cocktail recipes that you’re working from.

Setting up mash means dropping some corn and water into an ugly barrel, and add a sack full of sugar (like... 25 kilograms?), this gives you alcohol ready to distill in two, at most three days. Old barrel with wooden lid, no fermentation lock needed.
In winemaking, while adding sugar is often frowned upon anyway, regardless of what you do, you generally try hard not to get the sugar contents too high at the beginning since that inhibits fermentation. Using any old barrel for fermentation is... well, something you can probably do, but would one want to?
20 liters distilled give 8 liters of 50-55% moonshine. Since alcohol does not appear out of nowhere, this means the mash must necessarily have 20% of alcohol. That's quite steep for a random mix of stuffs in an old barrel. My yeast usually tolerates 16-18% at most. Admitted, there are special high-alcohol yeasts as well as ""turbo"" yeasts, but they make no mention of any such thing.
You get mash ready to distill in two days (20% in 2 days, that's, well... wow) but if you heat it up to around 70°C (so, basically killing the yeast!), you can do it in hours, not days.
Using a ""booster"" which is basically a second cooling spiral in a box, doubles the amount of alcohol you get out. As does a cooling spiral in the main tank.
Since the booster cannot possibly create alcohol out of nowhere, does that mean that one normally operates at below 50% efficiency?
Making the distill from copper is useful because it absorbs the large amounts of sulfur dioxide that are generated during fermentation. More copper, more good.
In winemaking, if you get noticeable amounts of sulfur dioxide, it means you fucked up the fermentation (except when making fruit wine from oranges, there it's pretty common).
Malted corn needs no yeast for fermentation, and you get no headaches from it that way. I'm inclined to believe the opposite as far as headaches go, since no yeast means you run a wild fermentation. In winemaking, this is normally something that you absolutely want to avoid if you can help it. Wild fermentation, and rapid, ultra-high alcohol production?
Moonshine sells for 25-30 dollars per liter. Not sure about alcohol prices in the USA, but I can buy alcohol legally (and not made from river water in a dirty barrel) for that amount of money here.


So, is there anything in there which (apart from running when police shows up) is even remotely realistic?

The hop plant is a vigorous, climbing, herbaceous perennial, usually trained to grow up strings in a field called a hopfield, hop garden (nomenclature in the South of England), or hop yard (in the West Country and U.S.) when grown commercially. Many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers around the world, with different types used for particular styles of beer.

Ice cubes are not nice cubes
Most of your typical highballs (shot of liquor topped up with a soft drink) are served &quot;on the rocks&quot; - with as much ice as the establishment thinks it can get away with. The longer you hold your drink, the more of the ice will melt and dilute the beverage.
The same goes for beers that will typically be consumed cool, like IPAs or lagers. Watch out for American Adjunct Lagers (Bud, Coors) in particular - you do not want to drink those warm.
On the other hand, darker beers are often served at what's called cellar temperature, so it's no big deal if you let them stand for a bit.
Try stronger flavours
A lager or a sweet white wine is as drinkable as juice or water, meaning that it will not last too long. Go for a red wine or strong beer - I recommend Belgian quadrupels, barleywine, stouts (especially Imperial or barrel-aged) and Imperial/Double IPAs. As an added bonus, these are not typically consumed ice-cold. For mixed drinks, lowballs (cocktails that are mostly liquor) are a good choice. Order them neat or straight (no ice) to avoid dilution. Can't go wrong with an Old Fashioned or Sazerac.
Variety can be nice
Drinking the same thing all night can be a little dull. If a bar has a good selection of beers, it will offer a flight - 4-6 small glasses with different beers. This typically costs as much as, or slightly more than, one pint of beer. It will also help you pick a beer in the future, since you get to sample a whole bunch.

In fact Greek wine was highly praised by the Romans and incorporated viticulture into their own culture, thanks to the Greeks. The white  Retsina or Resinated wine of the ancient Greeks is still produced in Greece and is locally very popular. 

There are a few wineries in Europe, notable Italy that make a claim (loosely) of producing a truly Roman wine, but interpretation is still left to the reader.

First of all, there is the Cesanese Wine


  Cesanese could have been the local wine of ancient Rome.
  
  •It’s quite possible that Cesanese was the red wine of ancient Rome because the grape is quite old and existed in the region during pre-Roman times.
  
  •However, there is no physical records to prove this, just ampelography (the study of grapes).
  
  •Evidence of Cesanese dates back to the 1400s from agricultural contracts that were preserved in local monasteries.
  
  •There are only about 1500 acres of Cesanese vineyards left around Rome and the province of Frosinone in Lazio, Italy.


A second possibility is Frascati Wine:


  The Romans referred to it as the Golden Wine both for its color and its value.  It has become embedded in the cultural and economic traditions of the city.  In fact, in 1450, there were 1,022 taverns in Rome.  Producers of Frascati owned almost all of the taverns.  It has been said that Frascati is the most often mentioned wine in Italian literature.  Pope Gregori XVI, in the first part of the 18th century, said it was his favorite wine.
  
  The wines made in close proximity to Rome are collectively known as Castelli Romani, nine communes that produce wine in the Alban Hills, which are just south of Rome.  The vineyards range from 200 to 1,000 feet in altitude.  The Soils are well drained and volcanic.  The Mediterranean provides some influence but the climate is more affected by the hills.  Of these, Frascati is the most famous.  It has historically had a widespread reputation as an inexpensive and serviceable white wine served in the cafés of Rome.  The potential, however, is there to really improve the wines.  


Mas des Tourelles offers some unique “Archeological Roman Wines”:  


  These wines are only available in France (and in few quantities in Germany).
   As many people contacted us to have informations on the way to buy and taste these wines in the US, you should know that it is hard to export wines without having a registered importer. It need also that this company can after deal with a reseller that can work with all the states.
  
  Mulsum
  
  Like testifying the passages of Pline the eldest, the blend of wine, honey and a certain number of plants ans spices (cinnamon, pepper, thyme ect...) are usedin making this famous wine, which was often served to the « gustatio » (before the meal as an aperitif).
  
  However, it also accompanies filet of duck with figs, small quails with grapes and pine kernels, very spicy dishes, Roquefort or chocolate fondant. To serve at 14°.
  
  Turriculae
  
  Made exactly according to the writings of Lucius Columelle, it displays the tastes of the Romans as far as dry wine is concerned. The addition of seawater, fenugrec, defrutum (grape juice concentrated to boiling point) ect..., during the vinification makes an amazing and complex wine. Roman dishes, such as oysters ans smoked fish, are wonderful with our wines of recent years.
  
  However, in the years of 2746 - 2747, you will be able to serve it with fried foie gras or cakes with nuts. To serve at 18°. « The fenugrec confers it to the particular « vin Jaune » taste and it has a detectable smell due to the notes of nuts and almonds. The taste of the Turriculae proves to be rich and supple with a round prune flavoured finish.
   (La Revue des Vins de France - Mai 1999)
  
  Carenum
  
  This sweet wine, described by Palladius, is produced by fermenting very mature grapes with plants, quince and defrutum. A delicately viscous and silky wine notes of quince and subtle aromas of crystallised peaches, it is a wonderful accompaniment with “foie gras” and fruit tarts.
  
  To serve at 14°. « The wine is of an amber colour, and its smell hesitates between peach and caramel. These smoky and caramel notes are also present in its mellowt taste. It makes a very nice aperitif ».
   (La revue des Vins de France - Mai 1999)


To make things a little more interesting it could be noted that Italian Scientists have planted vineyards with the aim of making wine using techniques from classical Rome described by Virgil.  


  Archeologists in Italy have set about making red wine exactly as the ancient Romans did, to see what it tastes like.
  
  At the group's vineyard, which should produce 70 litres at the first harvest, modern chemicals will be banned and vines will be planted using wooden Roman tools and will be fastened with canes and broom, as the Romans did.
  
  Instead of fermenting in barrels, the wine will be placed in large terracotta pots – traditionally big enough to hold a man – which are buried to the neck in the ground, lined inside with beeswax to make them impermeable and left open during fermentation before being sealed shut with clay or resin.

5081,2,,2016-06-10T21:29:15.540,2,,"Hangovers

Primary causes are dehydration and toxins built up in your system from the impurities in the alcohol you've been drinking, but in my personal experience and research sugar content can also contribute.


Dehydration


Alcohol makes people urinate more, which raises the chances of dehydration occurring. Dehydration can give the individual that sensation of thirst and lightheadedness.


Impurites


Most alcoholic beverages contain small amounts of chemicals
other than ethanol as a by-product of the materials used
in the fermenting process (e.g., grains and wood casks). Congeners
are complex organic molecules with toxic effects including
acetone, acetaldehyde, fusel oil, tannins, and furfural. 

Spirits have these in higher quantities than beer or wine due to the distillation process. 


Sugar content


Depending on what specific brands you are drinking and/or what you are mixing with high sugar content can cause you to have a sugar crash contributing to the hangover feelings.


Quality


In my personal experience the mornings after indulging with top shelf spirits are notably better than those done on a budget. Bargain spirits tend to be cut with grain alcohol and balanced with corn syrup contributing to the issue, but in general higher priced spirits tend to be more highly refined (Vodka for example tends to have more filtration the more expensive it is).

You've already opened the bottle because you wanted to actually enjoy the drink, here are step you can take to help ensure the slow and unstoppable flavor degradation takes as long as possible.


Store out of the light in a cool and dry place. 


A good general rule of thumb for just about any type of alcohol is to store the bottles in a cool, dry, and dark location this will prevent any fluctuation in the environment from causing changes and prevent UV radiation from getting in. 


Keep the bottle completely sealed.


Whiskey and other spirits will not mature like a wine in a bottle over time, in fact using an open cork will likely contribute to the breakdown of the flavor as the spirit will have more opportunity to oxidize. A proper rubber stop/cork will do the job just fine. 

If you are looking to ""age"" a whiskey your best bet would be to store it in a small used whiskey cask or in a sealed class bottle with whiskey cask staves added. Both will allow the whiskey to absorb more flavors over time.

5083,2,,2016-06-11T13:23:25.267,2,,"According to Vinpair here are The 9 Best Gins To Use In A Martini!  This list is not in order of best to worst. However, it does offer gin recommendations for various types of gin. Their number one all around recommendation is in fact Greylock.

1. Plymouth 


  Plymouth is technically both a style and a brand – how’s that for pizzazz? Plymouth is remarkably gentle. It has a sweet, delicate nose and a woodsy, lemony body. You might even get a bit of cinnamon bark on the palate. The finish is quite smooth, making Plymouth ideal for the bare bones martini. If the idea of drinking a cocktail that’s basically straight liquor freaks you out, Plymouth is a great gin to start with. It’s so welcoming, the first few sips of your martini might evolve into gulps. Drink cautiously.


2. Bombay Sapphire


  This is about as old timey as it gets. Savory, agreeable, and wonderfully cohesive, Bombay Sapphire is a gin that was born to hang out in a martini. While this low-key gin runs the risk of getting lost in fruitier cocktails, it rests perfectly alongside vermouth to create a balanced martini. Sapphire’s traditional botanicals (like coriander and grains of paradise) latch onto one another to make something great. Think of Sapphire as the perfect chocolate chip cookie: it seems simple, but one taste of a failed contender tells you it ain’t.


3. Citadelle BEST ON A BUDGET


  If you’re at a great bar and ask for a basic gin cocktail off-menu, there’s a good shot you’ll be tasting Citadelle. This French gin is a great quality purchase. Plenty of orange and overall citrus give Citadelle a nice burst of fruitiness without being fruit forward per se. While there are some floral notes to work with here, Citadelle really straddles the line between unique and eccentric, making it a great choice for a more aromatic, flavor-packed martini. Plus, at around $25, you don’t have a lot to lose. 


4. Euphrosine #9


  All right, so Euphrosine #9 isn’t exactly traditional. In fact, it’s like you took the floral notes in Citadelle and pumped them up a notch (or three). Still, there’s enough palatable sweetness to make Euphrosine #9 a happy martini gin. If you’re looking for a martini that’s on the sweeter side, reach for this NOLA-born pick from producer Atelier Vie. You’ll pick up on hibiscus, berries, and sweet iced tea. Dare we say it, there’s something rather flirtatious about Euphrosine.


5. The Botanist


  Hey, here’s something from Islay that isn’t Scotch! Bruichladdich crafts this interesting gin, which is made from thirty-one botanicals, twenty-two of which are native to Islay. While that may seem like an overwhelming amount of botanicals when compared to the standard seven or eight, The Botanist holds itself together surprisingly well. This is a complex gin, with a floral nose and an herbal palate. We get chamomile, mint, and citrus zest. Because this gin is so layered, you might want to add even less vermouth than usual. When it comes to your standard martini, The Botanist will really do all the talking, and in this case, that’s okay.


6. Gin Mare


  Do you prefer your martinis dirty? Then use Gin Mare. Seriously, this Spanish gin seems to be genetically engineered for a dirty martini. In a rare instance where branding fits product, Gin Mare is a Mediterranean gin made with olives, thyme, and rosemary amongst other herbs. The viscosity of the gin, combined with its garden-fresh taste, makes it the ideal spirit for a martini with just a hint of olive tartness. With this spicy yet still contained gin, you’ll feel like you’re going beyond a basic martini. Gin Mare is a great example of how a spirit can be both contemporary and classic at the same time.


7. Terroir


  Made from the gorgeous distillery at St. George’s Spirits, Terroir gin uses local Douglas fir. Unsurprisingly, Terroir gin was created as an homage to California’s natural resources. While drinking “fir” might put you off at first, it seems that the plant works to intensify the juniper, giving us a gin that has classic pine notes. This gin has a generous layer of crisp juniper bite, yet there’s a certain earthiness to it that prevents it from being too harsh or simplistic. Expect grassy notes, moss, tree sap, and of course, a heavy coat of juniper to round this all up. Like Bombay Sapphire, this gin is as solid as a California redwood.


8. Greylock BEST OVERALL


  This mighty gin from Berkshire Mountain Distillers has received tons of praise – and rightfully so. Straightforward, London Dry, and clean as a whistle, Greylock is a fantastic martini gin. Spicy licorice combined with lemon peel, black pepper, and a touch of cooking spice make Greylock both approachable and complex. Greylock will add lip-smacking flavor to your martini while still boasting enough unique spiciness to make your cocktail truly special. A hint of sugar-coated juniper berry will give way to just enough sweetness to make your martini quaffable as can be. This is an A+ gin for making martinis – we guarantee your guests will be happy with this crowd-pleaser.


9. Dorothy Parker


  Named after satirical poet and general snark icon Dorothy Parker, this gin from New York Distilling Company would make Ms. Parker proud. Similar to Euphrosine #9, the floral nose is rich with hibiscus, elderflower, pear, and cranberries. The juniper peaks its head around on the blooming palate and the finish, which is zesty. While this is half a world away from Greylock, it’s perfect if you’re looking to whip up a martini that’s a little lighter, bubblier, and of course, a bit more tart – like Ms. Parker herself.


Recommendation are always a hard subject to put across to others because what one person may enjoy, another may find less than favorable!

Yes wine snobs know the difference and they LOVE to talk about wine.

If you are not a wine connoisseur you might not know the difference between a $40 and $400.  But you would probably prefer the $40 over over the $4 of the same grape.

In a free market supply and demand establish the price and wine is a liquid (that is an economics term) commodity.  Even a small run will have a set of knowledgeable buyers.

Yes they may have just slapped a price on it as a marketing ploy. Does not mean the market will bite. For sure you don't need to bite. There are many reviews available. If you want to get into higher priced wines then find  reviewers / publications you trust.

While I may be able to tell the difference between a £10 bottle and a £200 bottle, I may in many cases prefer the £10 (and this has proved to be the case often enough that when I used to sell wines I used to sell based on what the customer liked previously, Not some description of the nose and palate that is upwards of 50% subjective and arbitrary)

Upwards of £200 there is almost no quality/taste difference, and upwards of £1000 the customer is solely paying for exclusivity, and the opportunity to drink or offer a glass no-one else can, or just to hold it as an investment.

Generally speaking, cask ale (as opposed to pressurised keg beer) is served, in the UK at least, and according to CAMRA's website, at cellar temperature: 12-14 C (54-57 F), whereas lager and keg beer is usually served much colder.

So much for the purist. My preference is always for cask ale to be served cool, but not cold, so that the flavours can be properly appreciated. Good quality lager should be served colder, and I prefer Czech pilsners at around 6-8 C - about the same temperature as you'd want white wine to be. But on a burning hot day in the African sunshine (where I'm from), there is nothing as refreshing as an ice-cold (and I mean ice-cold) ordinary mass-market lager, straight out of the bottle. You can't distinguish tastes as readily at those temperatures. Refreshment is the key there: you don't really care about taste in those circumstances (if you did you'd be drinking something else).

5097,2,,2016-06-14T20:38:20.093,8,,"The problem is, even if there were an objective measure of ""smokeiness"", there are different sorts of smoke tastes.

Usually TCP (""phenol"") content is the numeric measure of how smokey a given Scotch is, ranging from 0 pmm or close to it, up to around 170 pmm (Octomore).

However, there are a number of problems with that measurement being used. The biggest is that TCP only measures a specific component of smoke flavor, and in fact one of somewhat less importance. TCP is responsible for the sharp, chemical smoke flavor. However, polycyclic aromatics are responsible for the majority of ""smoke"" flavor. In fact, many fuels, such as wood, create relatively low proportions of TCP compared to peat. As such, it is more of a ballpark figure, and even then only if you are discussing alcohols smoked with the same fuels.

Because of those different compounds, the actual nature of smoke flavors vary wildly depending on the fuel and its origin, not just how much of it is used. Here are some examples of how I would classify the smoke flavor of various alcohols:


Laphraoig: Cigar smoke
Ardbeg: Bonfire, ""iodine""
Highland Park: Bacon
Octomore: Chemical, biting
Vita (Mezcal, not Scotch): A forest fire


As implied by the terminology I chose, it can be difficult to separate the smoke taste from the other tastes involved. There is even disagreement as to what constitutes ""smoke""/""peatiness"" - are ""iodine"" and/or ""phenol"" part of it, or entirely separate? If they are separate, can people reasonably separate them in tasting?

I am skeptical how useful a number could possibly be with the wide variety of smoke flavors to discuss. It's not just that the number would amalgamate many distinct flavors, it's also that different people are differently sensitive to the varying flavor compounds and might find the numbers ill-represent their actual experience because of that. 

As such, any number you might come up with is going to have a wide margin of error, since no one is going to agree on how ""smokey"" a given alcohol is.

It is of course theoretically possible to generate a number based on analysis of many different flavor compounds. However, that has not been done, and likely will not be. Even if it was, people would still have differing sensitivities. The closest you are likely to get is TCP ppm measurements and arbitrary numbers offered by reviewers.

At what temperature should a beer be served can be answered by the following statement:


  Most beers have an ideal serving temperature. There’s a chart below outlining which styles are served at what temperature, but as a general rule the temperature at which to serve a beer is correlated to the strength of the beer. As beers go up in alcohol, they are generally drunk at a warmer temperature. This is because stronger beers often are sipped slowly, and enjoyed for their complexity of flavor and aroma while weaker beers are often consumed for refreshment. For no style is this more apparent than American macro lagers, which are generally drunk so cold that you can’t taste them. There’s a reason those big brewers want people to drink their beers at tongue-numbing temperatures. As they warm up, they don’t taste very good. - The Craft Beer Temple.

5101,2,,2016-06-15T16:32:10.940,1,,"You should not keep the cork wet. The high alcohol content of most distilled spirits will begin to dissolve the cork, which is highly undesirable. They should always be stored upright. This applies to metal screw tops as well, as metal catalyzes the breakdown of organic compounds.

To improve the lifespan, the best thing you can do is keep the bottle in a cool, dark place. While it is true oxidation cannot happen without air, it is far slower without energy present, and reducing light-heat is much easier than removing air.

If you are able to keep the bottle in complete dark and below ~70F, it will last far longer. I store mine in a cabinet in my kitchen, and I have an Islay Scotch that has been open for 4 years and shows no signs of degrading, despite smoke being among the most easily destroyed flavors.

Always void sunlight. UV will quickly degrade the flavor of spirits. While the glass of most bottles blocks some UV, any getting through is extremely harmful.

Something else that can be done is to transfer partially filled bottles into smaller bottles. If you have half of a 0.750L, you might transfer it into 0.375L. This would reduce surface area and the amount of air in the bottle.

If you are committed to preserving a bottle that you do not often use, wine stores sell cans of Xenon which can be sprayed into bottles. The Xenon is heavier than air and covers the surface, preventing oxygen from coming in contact with the liquid. However, this is fairly expensive and will not prevent forms of heat/light degradation other than oxidation

An Irish Whiskey is distilled in Ireland and aged for a minimum of three years in oak barrels.

Thus an Irish distillery can not produce a Scottish whisky!

However our question does not end here because the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 define five categories of Scotch Whisky:


  •Single Malt Scotch Whisky: A Scotch Whisky distilled at a single distillery using only malted barley.
  
  •Single Grain Scotch Whisky: A Scotch Whisky distilled at a single distillery.
  
  •Blended Scotch Whisky: A blend of one or more Single Malt Scotch Whiskies with one or more Single Grain Scotch Whiskies.
  
  •Blended Malt Scotch Whisky: A blend of Single Malt Scotch Whiskies which have been distilled at more than one distillery.
  
  •Blended Grain Scotch Whisky: A blend of Single Grain Scotch Whiskies which have been distilled at more than one distillery.


But some Scotch Whiskies have a smoky flavor which originates from the peat fire over which the green malt is dried, prior to grinding and mashing.

Hold on for one moment, ""in Ireland, whiskeys distilled at Cooley are only distilled twice, and they make smoky whiskeys there too (Connemara).""

Thus the question as what the differences are between an Irish Whiskey and a Scotch whisky, other than how one spells whiskey remains a question of geography!

So burning alcohol is not a guaranteed way of finding out the percentage as whilst cooking wine will 'flame on' despite being low percentage and this is all to do with the vapor of the alcohol. Sure a High proof alcohol will catch fire easier but that will only tell you that it is a high proof alcohol not the percentage in it. A low proof vodka can ignite if a flame is held to it as the change in temperature will make it produce more vapor and it will ignite

Is burn distill or literally burn.  

Fire requires heat, oxygen, and fuel.   

Flash point is the temp it will burn with an external ignition source. The flash point is a function of temp. Not much effected by humidity.  

The flash points of ethanol wt % concentrations[102]
wt %    Temperature
10%     49 °C (120 °F)
20%     36 °C (97 °F)
30%     29 °C (84 °F)
40%     26 °C (79 °F)
50%     24 °C (75 °F)
60%     22 °C (72 °F)
70%     21 °C (70 °F)
80%     20 °C (68 °F)
90%     17 °C (63 °F)
96%     17 °C (63 °F)


Even at the flash point it will not generate enough heat to continue burning once the external ignition source is removed.  

Burn off would be hard to gauge and I don't think any alcohol (for human consumption) would burn 1/2 off at room temperature.

Give 1/2 is the threshold it is more like they just boiled the alcohol off in a pot. The boiling point of alcohol is 173 F. Just stop when the temp get to 173F. 50% would be 100 proof. Yes some water boils off even at 173 and some alcohol is left behind. But it is about a wash.  I would say the margin of error would be like 5%. If you did a true batch distillation would be within 1%.

The one you link to in the question, for instance, is only 5.2% alcohol.  

The process involves bringing the beer down to a temperature below the freezing point of water so that ice crystal form, and then drawing those crystals out.  This process is repeated until the beer reaches the desired strength, and in the case of Ice beer, that's probably not many times.  The goal is that when you remove the crystals, the remaining drink is both more alcoholic and has more pronounced flavors, and you can allegedly remove impurities, as I suppose they may serve as nucleation sites for the crystal formation.

(I chose RateBeer because you can use it to assign a simple rating of 1-5 stars, which is good for a first approximation.)

You should be aware of the different major styles of beers.  While you shouldn't dismiss an entire style based on one beer (maybe it was just that one that's not to your taste), if you find that you don't like most of the IPAs you taste or you tend to like most of the stouts, then you probably want to back off of the former and try more of the latter.  RateBeer (and also BeerAdvocate) shows the styles for individual beers, and you can search -- on those sites or in your store -- for more of those or similar styles.

If you can only buy beer by the 6-pack -- do you have beer-drinking friends?  Get together with a couple other people, buy one 6-pack per person, and swap bottles around.  Where I live, until very recently, beer could only be sold in full cases, and I joined a group of people to buy mixed cases using this approach.

Many white wines undergo a process that causes them to take on buttery flavors (which sometimes come across as buttered popcorn or even butterscotch).  That process is called malo-lactic fermentation, and here's the quick take on how it works.  Just after the grapes are made into wine, a special type of beneficial bacteria is added to the wine.  That bacteria converts one of the acids in wine (malic) to another type of acid (lactic).  The two acids feel different on the tongue.  Malic acid is very sharp (it's the acid in a Granny Smith apple); lactic acid is fairly soft (it's the acid in milk).  Most Chardonnay's go through malo-lactic fermentation and are therefore soft and buttery. (Taken from Why Do Wines Taste Buttery?).

Here is what I know about Rochefort 10 and some notes regarding this recipe:


Pilsner and belgian caramel malts are the grains used (according to BLAM and Sean Paxton). CaraVienne and CaraMunich are two possible belgian caramel malt choices. They only use one belgian caramel malt but which one they use is a secret so I figured it would be best to use a little of each (Sean Paxton does the same in his clone).
Carafa III is used mainly for some color (the candi syrup isn't dark enough alone) and for some aroma and body and flavor stability.
It isn't possible to get the real light and dark candy sugar used by Rochefort and I feel that D2 and amber candi syrup are the highest quality and closest we can get.
Sugars are reportedly 20% of the fermentables (as they are in my recipe)
Rochefort says they use wheat starch (used to be corn) which should add some dryness and some head retention and body. Sean Paxton says it is about 5% of the fermentables (as it is my recipe).
Sean Paxton claims they use 3 step mash is used with a protein rest at 122 and a saccharification rest in the ""mid-low 150s"". 153 seemed to be a good number in the mid-low 150s.
While Rochefort likely doesn't use a decoction mash, I've found that decoction mashes give better efficiency, better flavor, and better fementability for a minimal amount of additional effort.
The bittering hops are the ""traditional belgian hops"". I'm guessing Styrian Goldings. The flavor hops are a German hop. I'm guessing Hallertauer Hersbrucker. The hops are fairly subtle in this beer so those guesses are likely close enough if they aren't correct.
Rochefort centrifuges and bottles rather quickly but since most homebrewers don't have access to a centrifuge, 6 weeks of cold conditioning should suffice.
A starter should be used, but should be slightly under-pitched in order to get the yeast to produce the desire esters.
Still not sure on the amount of flavor hops vs bittering hops but IBUs should be 27 according to BLAM.
I'm tempted to pitch colder at 65 and let rise to 80 as I do with Westmalle yeast but I'm not sure if that will work with Rochefort yeast or if I'll get horrible fusel alcohols. For now, I'll try 68-73 as Rochefort does.
Rochefort ferments beers on top of older beers. I wonder if this is possible to replicate by starting with pitching into just 1/4 of the wort and adding an additional 1/4 more wort each day for three days. Probably not worth experimenting with this on the first attempt but might help with attenuation.

Eventually my exploration became intentional: I wasn't that familiar with different styles, I just tried as many new beers as I could, and eventually found my niche. 

In retrospect, if I could do it all over again with some guidance I'd want to have some understanding of styles. In general you have your dark ales stouts/porters/imperials, your lights standard lager/pilsner, your pale ales, your wheat ales, some fruity beers, some spiced beers, and whatever I'm missing.

So what you could do to start is do some research and find a good example of 4-5 different styles that interest you and that are available locally, and get an idea of which type of beer you like. After you figure out the type of beer you're interested in you could buy more examples of those styles and find which ones you like best.

A few notes that I'd keep in mind though:


Going from generic drinks to more 'complex' beers can be a challenge to the taste buds. At first try you might find some beers off putting, but after a while they grow on you. For that reason it'd also be smart to ease into beers with heavier flavour, until you're ready to approach them with an open mind and a palate that's used to new flavours. Try some balanced IPAs, wheat ales, some pilsners, maybe something sweet if you like first, go from there.
I've always found the beer I drink changes with the seasos. What goes best in cold weather isn't the same thing that goes best in warm weather. So that could affect your judgement of what you try

  Moonshine is any alcohol that is made illegally. It is usually make in
  small batches


In most cases if you are able to buy 'Moonshine' from a store it is generally not real moonshine 

I believe that it's called moonshine because it was illegal to make, so it was usually distributed at night time under the moonlight hence the name 'Moonshine'. It was popular to make as they could produce a high % drink very quickly but in most places there is a legal amount of time you have to distill an alcohol for. Moonshiners did not adhere to these rules hence why the drink was illegal.  

In places where moonshine has been legalized I would not consider it moonshine anymore as that just means they have allowed the distillers to bottle after any time they want in the processes instead of giving a set time for minimum distillation .

There are some legal Moonshine distilleries that label their alcohol as moonshine but most of these are playing on the growing trend of moonshine as all of these are still legit distilleries. They pay all the taxes and ship out there product so this is perfectly legal and they call it moonshine. While this is not a original moonshine, as it is all legal. Moonshine can be any really high proof alcohol but once that alcohol is sold and distributed legally it just becomes the same as any-other spirit and loses the true nature of being moonshine.

Some of our meads have kept well for several years.  Others have started to go off after six months or a year (but were fine before that).  The meads are bottled in capped (usually) 12oz brown bottles stored in a dark basement, and it doesn't seem to be about individual bottles.  This seems to be a case of ""some recipes keep longer than others"".  I'd like to know what properties contribute to this.

So far, the batch that has kept well for the longest (over 10 years now! I've been saving the last few bottles...) was very high-gravity for a mead; it's strong, sweet, and very smooth.  But another moderately-high-gravity mead degraded after a year or so, and lower-gravity ones have sometimes lasted longer.  So it seems like there must be other factors at play; it doesn't seem to be as simple as ""stronger (or sweeter) meads keep longer"".

Our production techniques have been about as consistent as home-brewing can be -- same equipment, same general process, same cellars, same fastidiousness about sanitation.  Varieties of honey and yeast have varied, and of course recipes have too.

This is not a home-brewing question; I'm not asking specifically how to make long-lived mead.  Rather, I'm asking what characteristics allow a mead to age longer without going off, which also helps me decide what to drink.

Moonshine was made a lot in the mountains because of the inaccessibility of where the mountain-folk would hide the Stills and the abundance of fresh mountain springs. They could also make the moonshine high proof to maximize cost/drunk ratio (I know it sounds close minded but not a ton of reasons to buy high proof alcohol).  

Liquor is measured in proof which is just 2x the alcohol % listed - 40% Vodka is 80Proof. There is not commercial grade 200 proof moonshine mainly because of physics. 


  This is because ethanol is not an ordinary mixture, it’s an azeotrope. Instead of boiling purely and separately at two different temperatures, its vapor will form a certain proportion. Steam from alcohol is 95.57 percent alcohol. Get a pot of 95.57 percent ethanol boiling and the steam will be 95.57 percent ethanol right down until the last drop evaporates.

Most whiskey is fermented from either all-corn, or corn and an other grain (like rye), but there are some boutique type whiskeys that use other grains like quinoa, spelt, flax, etc.  Technically any grain can be used to make whiskey, but it doesn't become ""whiskey"" until it has been placed in an oak barrel.  There are only a few other ""rules"" like the proof at which it is distilled. Whiskey has to come out of the still at 95% ABV (190 Proof) and then cut with water to nothing lower than 40% ABV (i.e. 80 Proof or higher).

Vodka can be made from corn, but unlike whiskey, it can be made from really anything that can be fermented.  Some of the most common starts for Vodka are potatoes, wheat, rye, and a few other grains, but Vodka can be made from virtually anything else that can ferment like grapes (Ciroc vodka), tomatoes, cucumbers, donuts, you name it. I have seen almond vodka and even milk vodka (as in vodka fermented from almonds and from milk respectively).  Vodka has to come out of the still at >95% ABV, but as long as it is cut with water to at the minimum of 80 poof (40% ABV) or higher, it's vodka. No matter what it started with.

The same exact corn ""vodka"" can be called whiskey it is comes out at the 95% ABV and then is placed in oak barrels. Note that I wrote ""placed"" and not ""aged"" in oak.  Whiskey has no age requirement, so the ""white whiskeys"" you see that do not read ""moonshine"" have at least touched oak.  If you see that the label reads ""moonshine whiskey"", it has touched oak too, if it just reads ""moonshine"" and has not ever touched an oak barrel, then technically is it strong grain vodka, but ""moonshine"" sounds more renegade I suppose. Corn ""vodka"" that comes out of the still at 96%ABV or higher, but doesn't touch oak is still Vodka, but technically could also be called ""Moonshine"".

Whiskey can be called ""bourbon"" if it is made in the USA, from 51% corn. It has to come out of the still at no more than 160 proof/80%ABV and it goes into the barrel at 125 Proof (62.5%ABV), and it has to be in the oak for at least 4 years in bonded warehouses under the U.S. government record.

5208,2,,2016-07-19T20:17:03.220,1,,"Even though you think this is a issue with certain types of mead during aging, I can't help but think you are just dealing with contamination that is turning some batches foul. I've never read of any type of mead that WORSENS with proper aging. So either you just don't like dry mead (maybe try carbonating it?) or you have contamination ruining your mead independent of what type it is. Alas, it is hard to find commercial meads to see what you actually like. Chaucers is wretched. I've seen some Scandinavian meads (like Vikings Blod) but they are pricey ($30+ for a bottle) so I've only tried a few. Maybe there is a mead brewers gathering near where you live? 

From The Meadery


  Your Mead was great when bottled, but the taste has changed
  dramatically for the worse after only a few weeks? What you probably
  have is a vinegar infection. Smell the Mead and look for any hint of
  an aspirin or vinegar smell. If you catch it right away, you can often
  save a batch by treating it with sulfite tablets, but the odds are not
  very good. You can only stop further damage, not reverse what has
  already occurred. Worse, if a vinegar infection got into your Mead,
  it's undoubtedly living in your brewing system somewhere. Go after it
  with a vengeance. Sanitize everything post haste, maybe even throwing
  out all of your siphon hoses (acetobacteria loves to hide there). Make
  sure there is a good seal on your air-locks. 
  
  If you have done all of this, and your Mead still tastes terrible
  after six months, try again. Examine all of your sanitation
  procedures, especially bottle washing. Make sure that any herbs or
  raisins or whatever that you might have added were not a source of
  bacterial infection. Most foul tastes are the result either of
  sterilizer contamination or bacterial infection. If you used an exotic
  ingredient, such as papaya peel, maybe you should try a new recipe.
  Maybe aging will solve the problem, maybe not. At a meadmakers
  gathering back in 1986 there was a Mead that everyone agreed had been
  the meanest they had ever tasted just the year before, but which had
  improved dramatically after a year of aging.


Oh, and another possibility that might slowly degrade your taste, from the same site:


  You don't want the Mead to sit on the sediment for too long,
  especially in a warm climate, because the spent yeast will begin to
  feed on the sediment (a process called autolysis), and this will give
  your Mead an unpleasant taste. If your Mead takes a long time to
  ferment, rack it every month or so if it keeps throwing sediment.


In this case you make be bottling too soon, or adding too much sediment when you do bottle.

5210,2,,2016-07-21T19:36:22.527,4,,"There are a number of reasons why you may perceive Becks as more bitter.

Firstly, some of the bitterness you are perceiving is a factor of the beer's age.  Beers like Becks, Heineken, Amstel, Yuengling, Miller/Coors/Budweiser, etc. aren't as strongly hopped as IPAs.  Nonetheless, hops are still the primary flavoring agent in these beers.

Some background first.  Hops are flowers.  Their bitter flavor comes from the release of the flower's alpha acids, which are among the most prominent resins and volatile oils within the flower itself.  These alpha acids are extremely sensitive to oxygen and begin to break down upon exposure to oxygen -- even the trace amounts inside a sealed bottle or keg.

Thus, any beer relying on hops as a primary flavoring agent is essentially ""on the clock"" from the time it's brewed.  When fresh (&lt;30 days after bottling/kegging), these hops taste as they were intended.  As time progresses, the hop flavors fade and are replaced by a skunky hop flavor which some people (myself included) perceive as being overly bitter.  Advanced palates can distinguish between these flavors, but it's often difficult to separate them without proper training.

Additionally, most mass-market beers (including all of the above) are pasteurized.  Anything that's been pasteurized will have a shelf life.  General guidelines are to avoid anything older than ~90 days for pasteurized beer, and try to find &lt;30 days when possible.  I check bottling dates religiously before making a purchase.

Note that some types of unpasteurized beer (Ex: traditional Belgian lambic) actually improve with age and can be cellared under proper conditions for upwards of 30 years!

Another reason is due to the Heineken flavor profile itself.  Just as alpha acids are sensitive to oxygen, the malted grain in beer is quite sensitive to direct sunlight.  Even 15-20 minutes of exposure to the sun can irreparably skunk a beer.  This is why most beer bottles are dark in color and 6pk holders have high cardboard sides.

Even though both Becks and Heineken are sold in green bottles, which allow significantly more light through than dark bottles, the Heineken flavor profile is decidedly more skunky.  And that's not to say it's bad; it's simply part of the flavor profile they have nurtured.  This skunky malt flavor is the dominant flavor in Heineken, and it frequently masks some of the underlying hop bitterness -- including bitterness from aged hops.

If you want to see what this flavor tastes like, grab two cans of Bud/Miller/Coors Light.  Pour one into a clear glass and put it in direct sunlight for 15-20 minutes.  Pour the other one at the same time but leave it in an opaque container shielded from sunlight.  It's a pretty distinctive flavor.

Finally, everyone's tastebuds perceive flavors a little differently.  It's entirely possible that another person tasting the same two beers from the exact same bottles comes to a different conclusion about bitterness.

In short, there are a number of factors at play here, and it may require a bit of effort to isolate them.  But hey, that's the fun part!

To do this in the bottle i. e. to simply uncork or unscrew the bottle and leave it is virtually pointless. The surface area of the wine exposed, coupled with the poor gas-liquid transfer means any change would in all likelihood, be undetectable. There would be more aeration occurring by the simple act of pouring the wine into a glass. The best method is to swirl the wine in a vessel. A wide decanter is best, but leave settling time (of solids) for older wines. A wide wineglass (where the glass is about the width of a bottle)  also works.  Ideally,  one would pour the wine into decanter where the volume of wine places the liquid level at the widest part of the vessel.  A good swirl maximises aeration /oxidation.  Give it time before pouring without the temperature rising too much above the ideal. Then, pouring from decanter to glass aerates further. This method is especially true for red wines. For white wines, more effective aeration is enacted by sucking the wine through the front teeth with air (almost slurping but only once the wine is in the front part of the mouth) while sipping from the glass.  For tannic reds, this method can leave a ""furry""  feeling on the teeth however.

So eating some food, particularly foods that absorb fluids like bread, will slow down the rate of alcohol absorption into your bloodstream, allowing your liver more time to metabolize the alcohol. 

So for a fixed amount of alcohol, drinking on a full stomach will make you FEEL less drunk because you spread out the alcohol absorption over time so your liver has more time to metabolize it.

However, you can still saturate your livers ability to metabolize alcohol by ingesting high volumes of alcohol and the absorptive ability of the food in your stomach is limited (unless you vomit it out) so it is FAR from reliable technique to drink but avoid becoming intoxicated or hungover since you are still absorbing all the ingested alcohol, just over a slightly longer period of time.

6228,2,,2016-08-11T21:37:49.283,8,,"The acidity (ph) of ethanol is relatively neutral (roughly equivalent to water), so milk and creams will typically mix fine with ethanol. In fact, it's the basis of many popular alcoholic beverages, like and &quot;egg nog&quot; (which is a spirit, a whole egg, cream, and simple syrup), or the White Russian (vodka, coffee liqueur and milk).
Milk or cream-based beverages can become curdled, but it requires a high level of acidity (e.g. lime juice) to be introduced prior to consumption.  It's why the &quot;cement mixer&quot; shot becomes curdled (the combination of cream in the &quot;Irish Cream&quot; and lime juice). If you are not familiar, do not try to drink a cement mixer &quot;shot&quot;, it is typically considered a really bad prank to pull on an unsuspecting victim. See &quot;Cement Mixer&quot;
Even though buttermilk is slightly more acidic than regular milk or creme, it's not enough to cause a reaction like curdling (unless you add the aforementioned high level of acid). Plus, milk already curds somewhat on its own in the stomach.
There is a popular myth that drinking buttermilk (or regular milk) prior to alcohol consumption has preventative benefits (i.e. &quot;hangover cure&quot;). However, there is no scientific evidence that supports the claim that drinking any type of milk (even buttermilk) before consuming alcohol does anything to stave off or reduce hangovers.
Conversely, it is well known that alcohol consumption slows digestion and reduces the absorption of nutrients, especially those found in milk. This is because alcohol reduces the secretion of digestive enzymes, which are what break down food in the stomach, including milk proteins and sugars. Alcohol also increases acid levels in the stomach, but it doesn't typically cause major negative side effects when consumed in moderation unless there is already another medical factor present.
High levels of milk or creams, followed by excessive alcohol intake can produce effects similar to lactose intolerance because the milk sugars are not digested well and move into the intestines. Once excess sugars are in the intestines, the bacteria there consume the sugars and produce large amounts of gas. High levels of sugar in the intestines also cause more-than-normal amounts of water to be drawn into the intestines...a.k.a. &quot;diarrhea&quot;.
As long as you aren't eating cheese curd sandwiches, made with flourless (i.e. all-cheese) cheese bread, with 5 slices of cheese and cheese soup, followed by high levels of alcohol, you should be fine.  Moderation with all things is the key.
Note: If you are diabetic, you run the risk of much higher levels of milk sugars going into the intestines and should consult a physician, because prolonged sugars in the intestines and stomach can lead to gastritis or even ulcers.

The only time that oxygen is beneficial is when your must or wort (IDK the currect term for unfermented mead) has cooled and you are ready to pitch the yeast. Oxygen at this point will help the yeast to multiply. But when the liquid is hot prior to cooling, and after fermentation is complete, you should be careful to minimize the amount of oxygen you are adding to it. Always stir gently and avoid splashing when racking and bottling. 

You use the word ""skunking"" in the title. True skunking (as opposed to staling or oxidation) is caused by a chemical reaction between hop extract and light. If you are adding hops to any meads, be sure to protect the bottles from light by storing them in a dark place, preferably in a box. Sunlight and florescent lights are particularly harmful.

How Long Do Spirits Last?


  Spirits
  
  The easiest class of booze to keep, sprits will generally last forever—although that statement comes with a couple of caveats.
  
  Spirits are usually high enough in proof that their alcohol content will preserve them indefinitely. Of course, because of that same alcohol content, you need to be sure to store them in a cool place. Above a radiator is not the right answer.
  
  Spirits do not ""get better"" in the bottle; they do not generally develop additional flavors in glass. For a spirit to age in the sense that we mean when talking of aged spirits, they need to age in wood. Glass doesn't impart additional flavor or aroma.
  
  Two things will happen to spirits in glass, however: oxidation and evaporation. As the booze reacts with oxygen, its flavors diminish over time. For short periods, this effect is subtle. Keep an open bottle of bourbon around a couple of months, and you probably won't notice any difference. Store it for years, though, and you might find it tastes a little flatter than when it was brand new.
  
  A small amount of evaporation from the bottle is inevitable and unavoidable; to make sure it stays just a small amount, though, remember what I said before: keep the booze in a cool place.
  
  But say you have a special bottle, something you want to keep around for a long time, and sip slowly over years. How can you protect the stuff inside? The simple answer is, transfer it into a smaller bottle. A few remaining ounces of that perfect single-malt, stored in its original bottle, will continue to react with the oxygen that fills up the bottle. A smaller vessel simply has less room for that spirit-snuffing oxygen.

6244,2,,2016-08-19T15:26:17.603,9,,"There are a few main things contributing to this 'hype'.

Firstly is the addition of the lime. It adds the citric acidity that pairs well with the light beer and gives it a unique zing that you don't find in other easily available beers.

Secondly, its a light beer that is easy and pleasurable to drink. It may not have rich notes that some love, or special characteristics, but what it gains is wide appeal and a product that you can't really hate, even if you don't absolutely love it. It is a very refreshing beer to drink when compared to a heavier lager or IPA.

Finally, is the marketing / ambiance it embodies. This is very likely a smaller contributing factor, but often one recalls having a nice corona on the beach as they relaxed, or correlate the beer to that image in their head, so it has that mental factor as well.

It comes down to the fact that reviews and 'class' aside, you should be drinking the beers you enjoy, and for many non-connoisseurs Corona fits that bill very well.

When its popularity fell a little bit, the company's marketing wing decided to provide provocative ads and increase the price.

That's my take based entirely on personal observation and this:  http://www.aef.com/pdf/effie/corona_2006.pdf  

Corona is not the first to use this marketing approach, gold schnapps did the same thing and were somewhat successful, though they didn't have the windfall that Corona had.  

Remember Gold Schnapps? It used to be a cheap schnapps, with enticing and interesting ""gold"" flakes drifting slowly through the drink.  

The new Gold Schnapps is more expensive and the companies accentuate the ""gold"" flakes...I haven't looked, but I'll bet this marketing also worked.

Esters are formed when an alcohol and an acid combine; creating esters is a common laboratory experiment in high-school chemistry - I remember making peppermint and banana.  This is the actual compound responsible for making peppermint smell like peppermint; the way we synthesized it in the lab isn't necessarily the way the peppermint plant makes it, but the result is identical.

A similar process happens during fermentation and aging of wine: the acids and alcohols present combine to form the compound that makes a cherry smell like a cherry, a thyme sprig smell like thyme, etc.

Just to be clear, most fermented beverages are going to have some of these aroma compounds as byproducts of fermentation.  But grapes are notable in that they produce many more different acids than other fruits.  So the range of possible aroma compounds is greater in wine than in, for example, cider - since apples don't have the variety of acids that grapes do, and can't make as many different esters.

Despite not fulfilling the first criteria, I suggest considering St John's Commandaria, a sweet desert wine made in Cyprus from white grapes.

From: A legendary wine


  The Commandaria wine of today still bears the name of this area [Grande Commandaria, Limassol District], for the Knights of St John gave this name to the wine not only because it was produced in the villages that constituted the Order’s fief - the Commanderie - but also because knighthood was then held in high esteem among the Catholic countries of Western Europe and among pilgrims who, on their way to the Holy Land, stopped at Cypriot harbors for provisioning - which of course included the sweet Commandaria wine.




The bottles are generally available for less than 20$ and bear what I believe is called the cross of St John. I have been lucky enough to have been introduced to its long history and the wine itself by a local enthusiast in Cyprus. I've also been impressed by its quality, which I consider outstanding for the price. It also would be an excellent sip after a good lunch or dinner, and as desert wine is typically drunk in smaller quantities than 'normal' red or white wine, the limited supply from a blessed bottle can be shared among more people.

There seems to be much ""science"" that would document that warm beer has zero capability to prevent a cold.

That ""science"" has so far failed to identify ""why"" warm beer or chicken soup is perceived by people as producing salutatory results is a failure of scientific vision. 


I would wonder this. 
 - Is the immune system supported by the oils, liquid, and vitamins in chicken soup? If so, how is this accomplished. 
 - Is the immune system supported by warm beer somehow? If so, how is the
   accomplished.

I wonder if adding heat alone so the body can devote more of its energy to the immune system helps fight off the flue virus that produces the thing we call a cold. I wonder if the presence of herbs in beer helps the immune system in a way we do not yet pay attention to, or understand.

Gentian root is one of the most common bitter agents. While I don't know of any clinical studies, gentian root has been used in herbal medicine for centuries to treat digestive issues. It makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bitter compounds are mostly found in plants and are often more or less poisonous. If the body produces more digestive enzymes in response to bitter flavors, the extra enzymes can neutralize the poison or extract more nutrition from the plant material. It's certainly not totally effective, salivary enzymes won't save you from hemlock poisoning, but it could reduce the ill effects of mild poisons.

The first, as Lying Dog said, is impurities. In fact, if they give taste, they also give you hangover
The second, much more important is the fact that alcohol is diuretic. Once drunk, the alcohol is converted into several substances (in several steps) by your liver. The problem is once the last substances cannot be converted into anything useful, it will be ejected from your body. How ? By urinating. But urinating requires water. The problem is that if you do not drink water as much as needed, your body will take it from where it can, including from your brain. Now think about a sponge left without water inside and you'll have a good idea of what your brain looks like after a night, inducing hangover the next morning.


To answer your question, yes, Vodka is the most efficient alcohol to avoid hangover. But you can also avoid it by drink enough water while drinking alcohol (typically, if I'm at a party where I drink a lot of alcohol, I drink a pint of water after 2 or 3 beers)

Also, try adding the extract to an un-hopped beer to to see how the flavor changes when mixed with other ingredients.

6284,2,,2016-09-15T05:21:05.457,5,,"Typically, it seems people expect single, double and triple to mean higher alcohol content.  But that is not exactly true.

You have single and double bocks with the same alcohol content.  Take Weihensthephaner for example (a respected 1000-year old monastic brewery): Weihenstephaner Korbinian is a double with 7.4% ABV. Weihenstephaner Vitus is a single bock with a higher ABV of 7.7%.  In this case, the single has a higher ABV than the double.

More grains and more sugar do not equal more alcohol.  The strain of yeast and temperature determine the survivability.  Some yeast can live at high alcohol levels.  You can feed them all the sugar and grains and they will still die and stop fermentation (producing alcohol) when the alcohol level 'limit' is reached.

The eisbock gets a higher ABV by freezing the beer and removing ice.  This removal of water is how the alcohol content is increased.  Again, most yeast cannot reach 12% (which one typically finds in an eisbock).

The single, double, triple label has to do with the strength of the beer overall, including nutrition (calories) and taste.  Remember, these 'doppels' were created for sustenance.

Careful with the word 'stronger' when talking about bocks.  It can mean more malty, darker, fuller, not just higher alcohol level.

2) Travel. Travel as much as you can and drink the local wines. If you find something that you really like and can afford to buy some, do so. You will never find your ""favourite wine"" by working your way systematically through your local wine shop.

3) Remember that wines change. One of the best wines that I ever tasted was a certain 1996 Amarone (Recioto della Valpolicella), and I was fortunate enough to be able to buy a case of it. However, once it was gone, it was gone. Later vintages (from the same producer) were not nearly as good.

4) Time passes. The wines that you love will be associated with treasured memories and inevitably belong to the past. You can never step into the same river twice. Such is the beauty of wine (and life).

Jägermeister and other herbal liqueurs do contain herbal essences that probably have some effect on your body. But not in any medicinal quality, otherwise it couldn't be sold as food in the EU by law. There are strict rules (e.g. Directive 2001/83/EC).

In general the usefulness of digestifs for the digestion is heavily discussed (there are opinions that the alcohol takes away any positive effect the herbs might have). But I don't have any reliable sources at hand.

And the alcohol is unhealthy, no doubt.

So from a medicinal point of view: stay away from digestifs and stop eating too much so you won't need any digestion-helper.

From a recreational or culinary point of view: If you enjoy the taste, a digestif is a great closure of a good meal and the psychological effect of ""believing it helps"" works sometimes. 

And i personally like the taste and drink it recreationally and not just as digestif.

There is something primal and fundamentally connected to nature about brewing, and being able to harness a fungus to produce alcohol.  Not only this, but something spectacularly human about being able to produce something by yourself, and brewing beer and wine is surprisingly easy.  Consider that you then get to drink something you made and the satisfaction of being self-reliant in this respect.

The satisfaction of self-improvement and being able to share your creations with others can't be put into words.  You most certainly can buy beer, but you absolutely can't buy the beer I make.   Also, mine costs a fraction of the price that you pay others to make for you.

I hope I have answered your question.   We brew because we can, because yeast is freely available to all, and because it improves our skills and human capital.  Most of all, just like any trade, whether it be a carpenter, a butcher, or a chef.... we get to enjoy the fruits of our labour of love.

Homebrew is healthy for you. It is a living beverage. All the yeast, enzymes and vitamins are all there for you just like nature intended. Large commercial brewers filter most of this out and some even have to add back in the carbonation.

Homebrew is not dangerous, the worst that will happen is bacteria will spoil the beer's taste. There is no documented case of contaminated beer that has killed anyone. The theory is since the yeast micro-organism already 'lives' in the beer they create an environment that is not favorable to other micro-organisms.

Finally if you are not old enough to buy alcohol, usually you can buy the ingredients and make it yourself. The brew shop I frequent is very close to a large college campus. Coincidence? I think not.

6299,2,,2016-09-20T11:48:50.833,12,,"Drinking less is the obvious solution.

But you can also reduce the causes:

One cause for a hangover are the metabolic products of the fusel alcohols (unwanted alcohols) in your drinks. First your body metabolizes the ethanol and then the fusel alcohols. That's why drinking alcohol helps against a hangover as if gives the body some more ethanol to work on and thus reduces the toxins of the fusel alcohols. That's why a Bloody Mary is a well known hangover cure.
So try reducing the amount of fusel alcohols you consume by choosing high quality drinks that have less of them.

Another cause is dehydration and lack of electrolytes. So start hydrating yourself before, while and after you consume alcohol. And to keep the water in your body, make sure, you add enough electrolytes to bind the water. In russia and other slavic countrys there is a culture of eating salty (electrolytes and increasing thirst), sour (helps making you thirsty) and fatty (proteins and delays alcohol absorbtion) food along with drinking. In a way it's like having a hangover breakfast while drinking.

All of this can be done when you wake up with a hangover: drinking some alcohol as ""hair of the dog"" (this will reduce the symtoms but increase the time you feel them but won't fix anything!), eating a rich breakfast, drinking lots of water (tea, juice, ...) and maybe pop a blood-thinner like ASS (Aspirin).

It is not, by any stretch a Black and Tan — and yes, the name would be seen as offensive by most in Ireland and I have never heard ordered by locals (this is a sure way to spot a tourist) — which, as far as I know, is normally made with a larger or pale ale (Smithwick's is a red ale), and whose ratio is more like 50:50. It would look something like this:



Smithwick's with a Guinness head is just that — the proportion of Guinness in the drink is just the head, i.e. maybe a inch on the top of the glass. The pint of Smithwick's is poured as normal, with a small amount of Guinness added at the very end, which sits on top of the pint giving it a head of stout. Adding too much Guinness at this stage will cause the beers to mix, and will ruin the pint.

Can't find a picture of it, but it will basically look like a pint of Smitwick's with a creamer (look and texture) head, and taste as such.

As a barman in a country pub for a couple of years during college, I had a couple of regulars who used to order it. It's not particularly common, but neither is it unusual — any barman should know what you want and be able to serve it.

1) Temperature absolutely plays a difference in beer taste. 

Too Cold


  The biggest issue with beer served too cold is the way the temperature masks many flavors and aromas. The cold temperature slows the volatilization of aromatic compounds causing them to linger in the beer. When these compounds are not released, it dramatically changes the apparent flavor and aroma of the beer, sometimes to the point where it may come across as thin and tasteless. (American Homebrewers Association).


Too Hot


  Warm beer, on the other hand, does allow for more of the flavors and aromas to come to the forefront, but as beer approaches room temperature the sensations from hop bitterness and carbonation can decrease, which can lead to an almost flat-tasting experience. (American Homebrewers Association).


So here are suggested temperatures for serving various types of beer. 

....................Beer ................................. Suggested  Temperature

American Mainstream Light Lagers...............     33° – 40° F / 1° – 5° C

Data from Tasting Beer by Randy Mosher.

2) Glassware makes a HUGE difference. The shape allows for nucleation sites, temperature control of beer, aromatic release/retention. (See /user/MDMA's full response to my question about glassware and beer here)

3) What type of beer is it? If it is a nano brewery, it could be several things (wild yeast, inconsistency in brewing process, fermentation time, bourbon barrels stored in, etc.).

4) What was your drinking environment the first time/subsequent times you drank? Have you ever eaten somewhere for the first time while starving and with good friends you haven't seen in a while? That food will forever be amazing in your mind. You go back years later with a normal appetite and people you see regularly and the experience can be very different.

6323,2,,2016-10-04T04:52:46.160,1,,"There's a good chance it's got to do with UV light. The chemical compound in hops that makes them bitter (isohumulones) can produce something called 3-MBT (3-methylbut-2-ene-1-thiol) when sunlight hits it. 3-MBT will make your beer taste skunky. A noticeable change in flavor will start to occur really quickly, within seconds of direct sunlight. If the bottle you had was green or clear, those allow light in, so they're susceptible to this effect. If the cup of beer you had came from a keg....the almighty keg is impervious. Additionally, any beer that you drink outside can be affected. Bitter beers like IPAs will suffer faster and more noticeably because they have more isohumulones. Though, this doesn't happen to all beers. Some of the bigger breweries, like Miller, use a stabilized hop extract that won't produce MBT.

The amber beers can have tastes of caramel and dark fruits like raisins.  Stouts, like a Guinness, will have roasty flavors, and those and porters can have hints of chocolate and coffee.

The easiest is probably to add a little dark beer to your light beer, like you have with a half and half.   The downside here is that you open two beers when you only want to drink one, but you could always save the mix-in beer in the fridge.  You could also add come coffee, a tablespoon at a time, and see if you like it.  Or, you could cut it with, not a dark beer, but an amber colored one like an Irish Red, or a Mexican lager like a Negra Modelo, if you don't want too much of a ""dark"" flavor.

If you really want to do it ""right"" and you live near a home-brew shop, pick up some caramel malt, like a crystal 40 or 60, make a little tea with it in some warm water, and add that to the beer.  That's basically what goes on in the brewing process.

It is expensive, but it is not the type of beer one drinks several bottles of.  Each year, the ABV sits around 15 to 16 percent.  I like to say that this is the pumpkin beer that should end every other breweries' attempts to craft a pumpkin beer.  They should all stop and deem Avery the winner.  It is not just a little aroma of pumpkin, it is a mouthful of thanksgiving with each sip.  This beer is heavy and creamy and fills your nose with nutmeg and cinnamon.  Skip a meal for this one, it will fill your stomach.

If you want to explore a wonderful variety of this brew.  I would suggest Avery's RUMPKIN, which is their pumpkin ale aged in rum barrels. This is a bit more of a kick in the mount though, as it not only get's a great deal of sweetness from the rum, it also gets a bit more alcohol too.  Rum barrel aging is a unique process.  So you get to try something that is likely new to you.  So often, brewers use other spirit and wine barrels, but you do not see as many use rum or tequila barrels.  Kudos to Avery for that.

Both brews are priced around 10 bucks per 12oz bottle.  And you will need to shop at a specialty store for them.  I occasionally see them in Schnucks in Saint Louis though (which is a grocery store).  They are pretty rough when they are fresh.  So I like to grab a stock each year, then drink the ones I purchased the year before.  Age them upright at cellar temps, IN THE DARK.  I can not stress that enough.

So if the final gravity is 1.012 (PDF for clone recipe), crunch the numbers and you end up with 12 degrees.

For example, if I'm looking into a beer glass and something is floating inside, I would be surprised to even notice it.  From the point of view of the ashes.

Answer: no, there is no change in taste in small amounts of ashes.  The more ashes you add to the beer the more of a scratchy texture but no difference in taste.

In that it states: ""Alcohol flavors (if present) should be smooth and wellaged, not harsh, hot, or solventy. Very light oxidation may be present, depending on age, but an excessive molasses, sherry like or papery character should be avoided. Aging and conditioning generally smooth out flavors and create a more elegant, blended, rounded product. All flavors tend to become more

If you are trying to carbonate your home-brew with nitrogen, you will need to rack the beer into the keg and then lower the temperature before force carbonating with Nitrogen. If you're just trying to drink a nitrogenated beer, provided ideal storage conditions (little to no light, cool, undisturbed) there should be a &quot;best by&quot; date on the bottle somewhere.

Why Are Nitrogen Beers Are &quot;A Thing.&quot;

Traditionally, cask-conditioned English ales were served with a hand pump, or “beer engine.” The barrels in the cellar of the pub were connected to the tap faucets on the bar upstairs, and the beer was drawn up by pumping air into the barrel. These hand pumps delivered about 25 to 30 pounds per square inch (psi).
Air is 78 percent nitrogen, so they were pumping beer that had a low level of carbonation with something that was mostly nitrogen.
The trouble with using air to pump beer is that the remaining 21 percent of air is mostly oxygen. If a keg is going to be consumed quickly, using air is okay. But if the beer is consumed over a period of more than one day, it quickly becomes oxidized. To avoid oxidation but duplicate the effects of traditional cask ale, modern pubs pump their low-carbonation draft ales with a mixture of 75 percent nitrogen and 25 percent carbon dioxide at high pressure, about 28 to 30 psi. Homebrewers can do this too, but using nitrogen is not as easy as CO2.
It’s important to understand some basics. Nitrogen doesn’t behave like CO2. Nitrogen doesn’t have the affinity for going into
solution like carbon dioxide does. Professional breweries “nitrogenate” their beer by chilling the beer to 32° F and forcing nitrogen into it under extremetly high pressure. Nitrogenation helps brewers re-create the smooth feel and thick head of cask ales. If you tried brewing a batch of homebrew, moving it into a keg, then pressurizing with nitrogen for a number of days, the only result would be a tap delivering very flat, high-pressure homebrew. As a safety note, most homebrew equipment is not designed to handle the pressure needed to force nitrogen into beer.

Information for Nitrogen-Homebrews

First, make sure the beer recipes you want to dispense will be good at 55° F with low carbonation. The best candidates for this treatment are traditional stouts, porters, milds, and bitters.
Good hop flavor and aroma and the flavors from specialty grains are important in beers with low carbonation. If you have some of your favorite beer bottled, open one and let it sit for a couple of hours before drinking it. If it seems better that way, that recipe is a good candidate for a traditional English draft beer.
To be prepared for traditional serving, a beer must have a low level of carbonation. If you are adding priming sugar when kegging, cut the amount to one-third cup of corn sugar in five gallons of beer. If you are artificially carbonating, put the keg in the refrigerator, apply 20 psi CO2 pressure and give it a shake. The next day, take the keg out of the refrigerator, let it warm up to 55° F, and draw off some beer to check; there should be some carbonation, but not much. Stir the beer with a spoon and see if some CO2 bubbles are knocked out of solution.
When you feel that the beer has the proper low level of carbonation, keep it at 55° F and reduce the CO2 pressure to 5 psi to maintain it. A stick-on strip thermometer on the keg is very helpful for checking the liquid temperature.

Kahlua and Baileys are commonly used, as are more woodsy whiskeys. Avoid anything with carbonation, as the carbonic acid will again mess up the flavor of the coffee (beer is a no-no) and you should also avoid scotches, rye, or other peaty-earthy whiskeys.

Also, rum is pretty good with coffee, if you're using raw sugar in your coffee - demerara and rum are best friends.

A second variation on this, which is far less potent is to replace Tuaca with 1/2 a shot of Chambord and 1/2 a shot of Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur and mix thoroughly .  This will an tasty adult white chocolate mocha.

Finally, a classic cocktail combination is coffee (with or without cream) and Sambuca.  Sambuca is often served with 3 coffee beans, but it works very well with an entire cup.  Sambuca contributes a lithe sweetness that delicately lingers in the mouth.  Avoid if you don't like Anise or Licorice.

For a seriously potent version of Sambuca and Coffee swap out Sambuca for Absinthe(not refined).  In addition to the alcohol content, Absinthe also offers a jolt akin to what caffeine provides.

6370,2,,2016-10-25T13:22:44.277,1,,"Keep in mind that smoking diminishes one's ability to taste(I'm not sure about Vaping). I haven't found any literature that explains if just only one cigarette will change your sense of taste, but anecdotally I believe it will have an effect. 

Smokers' bitter taste buds may be on the fritz

This a large reason that smoking and drinking often go together.  Alcohol tastes less potent to smokers.  As an obvious result, more potent liquors like moonshine or absinthe will go do down a little easier for smokers.

In my mind, the most classic pairing of smoke and alcohol is cognac or regular brandy and a cigar.  Often people dip their cigars into brandy before drinking.  Generally, this is considered a faux pas and unnecessary given modern humidors. The origin of this tradition was to add moisture to the cigar.  The dipping can take from the nature flavor of the cigar.  However, I recommend it for particularly cheap or unpalatable cigars, or if you don't like them at all but are smoking one anyway.  Be careful though, it can be a little like putting ketchup on Filet Mignon.

Nonetheless,  The flavor of cognac/ brandy compliments cigar smoking quite nicely.  You can sip them and enhance the flavors of the cigar.  My preference is Grand Mariner(made from cognac and bitter orange), and a cigar, although I am not cigar aficionado so I don't have a specific cigar to recommend.  The Grand Mariner flavor rests on the tongue after drinking and creates a very rich mouth feel, particularly in combination with smoke.

Vaping seems prime for pairing with alcohol.  Given the myriad flavors available, I think match flavors would be good.  Consider the vape juice flavor as an ingredient in your cocktail.  Jack and Coke? Try vanilla vape juice and it will be reminiscent of Vanilla Coke.  Try Cake Vape and Gingerale and Vodka to create the impression of Cream Soda.

The American version which has an emphasis on hops, IMO not as similar to old ale.
The English version which while hoppy is also sweeter and has more fruity flavors than the American version and IMO does seem similar to old ale. 


If I were to compare an English barley wine to an old ale the differences among the higher end of the style seem minimal. However, I think that even on the higher end the old ale has an emphasis on the aged quality. In the smaller versions, less ABV, examples of English barely wine I think it is less malty than an old ale. 

I also found the BJCP style guidelines style comparison useful for the English barley wine and old ale because they are so similar. I've included them below for reference.

""Old Ale Style Comparison:
Roughly overlapping the British Strong Ale and the lower end of the English Barleywine styles, but always having an aged quality. The distinction between an Old Ale and a Barleywine is somewhat arbitrary above 7% ABV, and generally means having a more significant aged quality (particularly from wood). Barleywines tend to develop more of a ‘mature’ quality, while Old Ales can show more of the barrel qualities (lactic, Brett, vinous, etc.)."" (From BJCP 2015 guidelines)

""English Barley Wine Style Comparison:
 Although often a hoppy beer, the English Barleywine places less emphasis on hop character than the American Barleywine and features English hops. English 
versions can be darker, maltier, fruitier, and feature richer specialty malt flavors than American Barleywines. Has some overlap British Old Ale on the lower end, but generally does not have the vinous qualities of age; rather, it tends to display the mature, elegant signs of age."" (From BJCP 2015 guidelines)

6386,2,,2016-11-15T23:27:05.247,2,,"TL:DR;
Not a lot of difference, but science favors carbonation for long-term storage. In a keg system, long-term storage isn't a factor, and there's no appreciable difference.

In order to answer your question, a couple of things, first. 'Stay good'; is somewhat nebulous, but let's say that it consists of three things;
1. Not being oxidized or lightstruck
2. Not being infected
3. Being pleasant to taste

Point 1: Oxidation can be minimized by using good brewing practices, which (if you're bartending) is kinda out of your control. If you're the brewer, that's different. But oxidative compounds can be in your hops or grain, so that may still be out of your control. 
Lightstruck is easy to avoid with good storage practices and brown bottles [- first google listing on beer cellaring] here, and it has good info.1.

Point 2: Beer isn't sterile. If it were sterile, it wouldn't be good. Pasteurization can make beer nearly sterile - so close that it pretty much is sterile - but pasteurized beer generally has a shorter shelf life than beer with the right active microbes. Case in point: a pasteurized pale american lager at 3 years vs. a non-pasteurized lambic at 3 years. Or a bottle of Brett-aged beer. Lambics and wild beers have tons of microbes. Microbes do good things for stability, long-term. Or bad things, if you have bad microbes.

The reason they stay good and don't make you sick is that the yeast, lactobacilli, pediococcus et al, alter the Ph so that hostile microbes won't grow, which leads me to the finale of point 2:

Co2 in solution drives the Ph of the liquid down, or towards acidity. Hard science paper about that here(although you can only read the preview without membership, there's a graph in the preview that shows the effect on atmospheres of dissolved Co2 vs Ph). 

Point 3:Being pleasant to taste. Although this could be considered subjective if we got into the flavor of N vs Co2, it really just hearks to point 1: no bad taste chemicals. Good storage and good brewing make for good beer.

I looked all over for examples of nitrogenated beer that would be considered cellar-able. I didn't find any. Does this mean that Co2 is better for the health of your beer?

Not necessarily. In order for N to come out of solution, it needs nucleation sites, which are usually other N bubbles. Coming out of a tap, it has bubbles. With a widget, it also has bubbles, but I'd be concerned about the alcohol slowly degrading a widget, were I to store nitrogenated beer long-term. Plenty of science out there about degradation of plastic when exposed to chemicals.

So, in the end, it's just preference - unless you're cellaring.

But for white wines we had a closed lid with way for the CO2 to escape easily. Sulfites will be blown out with an active fermentation so they are pretty useless while fermenting, but they need to be added as soon as fermentation is done.

6392,2,,2016-11-17T07:45:30.367,0,,"Yes, I have the general simple rule you are looking for: Price.

The cheaper a wine is (especially for Cabernet), the earler you should drink it. But there are some underlying explanations to explain why.

Cabernet Sauvignon is built for ageing. It has very thick skin, high levels of acidity, and low sugar content. For ageing, tannins are good, acidity is good, and too much alcohol can be bad. The sugar in Cabernet Sauvignon has an alcohol potential of about 12.5%, against 14.5% for Merlot. 

Tannins and acidity need time to soften, that is why a normal Cabernet wine from a respectable winery should need 2-4 years before it can be appreaciated, and reach its peak in 5-10 years. 

The lifespan is shorter for lighter wines, for example in vintages where it rained a lot, the wine can be diluted and age a lot quicker. In these conditions the bottle may reach its peak in less than 3 years. This is also true for industrial wines who do not want to take risks and do not wait long enough for the grapes to mature, giving very light wines. If you look at Bordeaux wines, a 2010 tastes younger than a 2013. Because 2010 was hot and 2013 was very wet.

Over the years, wineries have developed some techniques to push the ageing potential further:


In the Vineyard: Planting vines in higher density (going up to 10000 plants per hectare in the Medoc region), performing green harvests, using only old vines, to get more fruit concentration.
In the Wine Cellar: Some techniques are used to extract the grapes and concentrate the wine even more. Pre-fermentation cold maceration has become a popular practice for example. Or some more extreme things exist, like reverse osmosis, which is used in some top Bordeaux Chateaux to extract water out of the wine. The less water there is, and the more dry matter it has, the more ageing potentiel it gets.
In the Ageing Cellar: Top red wines all over the world are aged in new oak barrels during nearly 2 years. Oak adds new types of tannins and anti-oxydants to the wine. This increases ageing potential a lot.


Cabernet Sauvignon is especially famous for its affinity for Oak. The Oak softens the Cabernet tannins while adding more of its own extra soft tannin flavours. This way the bottle can be opened earlier than expected but also age until later than expected !

All these techniques make the wine more complex, and enable it to age longer. These techniques also cost a lot of money.

Some great Cabernet Sauvignon from the Bordeaux region should only be opened starting from 20 years after bottling, but will need around 40-50 years for their most complex aromas to show.

So in the end you got to know the techniques and terroir quality of the vineyard who produced your bottle, and the quality of the vintage. But that is usually reflected in the price of the bottle anyways.

6393,2,,2016-11-17T17:10:06.770,2,,"Being a former winemaker, Cabernet can made in a variety of styles from cheap Trader Joes Cabernet ready to drink the day you buy it, to Napa Valley cabs that won't soften up for at least a decade. In fact, I've had 20 year old cabs that were still so tannic, I don't think they would ever soften up.

From a winemaking perspective, usually I found that wines taste flat for several months after bottling. I think the introduction of Oxygen (not necessarily a bad thing) at bottling time alters the wine for a while, but with age things start to level out. For a high quality cab, I would wait a year after bottling for things to come around and you can taste full flavors. BUT, that doesn't really mean the wine is ready to drink. Usually several years after bottling cabs start to soften their tannins and become much more approachable. Not everyone likes that though, many people like a younger fruitier wine. YMMV. 

This is for wine that is stored in a temperature controlled environment and not on your kitchen counter. Heat makes the process speed up but not necessarily in a good way. 

There are no hard and fast rules about when you drink a wine. I would error on the side of drinking sooner than later because it's possible to get vinegar or a corked wine the longer you wait. If you have several bottles of the same wine. Sample one every couple of years until you think they are ready.

If you want to go ahead with a boilermaker anyway I'd recommend getting a mid-range bottle of whisky. Something with some semblance of flavour and quality, but not so good that you're wasting a good liquor by mixing it with beer. Come to think of it, this rule probably holds true when mixing with anything, although I tend to use fairly cheap whiskies for cocktails. 

In terms of specific whiskies, you could go with something like a Bulleit Bourbon or a Black Bush Irish Whisky, and if those are too pricey you could down-grade to a Wild Turkey or Crown Royal.

The beer you choose depends much more on your taste in beer, as the flavour of beer varies much more than does the flavour of whisky. In general, if you mix with a lighter, more generic beer the flavour of the whisky will be quite strong, whereas if you go with a stronger flavoured beer the whisky will be more subtle. 

If it were me, I'd go the stronger route to mask the taste of the whisky, because when I drink a beer that's not really what I want to taste.

I've noticed this was a Trappist beer. As such, there is probably as much yeast in there as homebrew beers that have had sugar added to carbonize the beer during the bottling process. When too much sugar is added at this step, the homebrewing community refers to the disaster that happens next as ""painting the ceiling."" This comes from the present yeast having too much sugar to eat and over-pressurize the beer. The first time this happened to me I thought someone was shooting either in or right beside my house. I know that the Trappist Monks have been doing things a lot longer than homebrewers; but, the situation is still plausible. 

There is also a chance for glass defects. Or perhaps, the bottle was knocked over and created a stress fracture that over time gave way with your slight nudge. You could always reach out to Westvleteren XII Gurus and ask what is the best way to store the beer so this doesn't happen again. Sorry for your loss! :(

Too much sugar for the secondary fermentation in the bottle. Homebrewers do this ALL THE TIME. Turns your beer into little hand-grenades. Sometimes fermentation is not complete and with the normal addition of sugar at bottling can cause problems. This happens frequently in high gravity beers.
Infection - by this I mean something other than yeast was in the beer and started eating the sugar to make the carbonation in the beer. It could be a wide variety of agents from yeast to bacteria to fungus. They convert sugar to CO2 at different rates than yeast. Many times they produce more CO2 causing gushing beers and sometimes broken bottles.
Defective bottle. 99.99% of the time bottles are built to spec, but occasionally one slips through with a defect and many times that can lead to a bottle failing. Also, bottles are sometimes dropped or banged around causing a crack.

I've seen Chris White the founder speak at a homebrew event and it was very interesting. He has a Phd in microbiology from the university of california and sells to all sorts of professional brewers, distillers, and wine makers.

I'll summarize the information from the references here, 
but the bottom line is that they store samples at very cold temperatures so it's metabolism is almost shutdown and it won't evolve.


Brewers isolate there yeast in slants or plates. These are the pure strain.
The yeast that is isolated will be stored at a very cold temperature to remain dormant and unchanging. (-80 Celsius)
When they need to recharge because their yeast has drifted they remove a small amount from storage.
Using petri dishes they will grow a small size they can verify is still good.
With this small batch they will add to wort (what brewers call the sugary liquid that makes beer) and then make a large batch of yeast.

Absinthe is always green due to the presence of Artemisia absinthium's chlorophyll. The beverage is based in and some kind of product is added in order to create a reaction to make it turn to X color.

2) How to breweries keep a consistent flavor over time

I'll answer the second one first...

As to how do they keep the flavor the same all the time, year after year even though ingredients taste different from year to year? It's all about blending. They try to brew a consistent beer but it might be too hoppy or malty or strong or whatever but they will dilute, or add hop oil or blend in another beer that can adjust the flavor profile to exactly what they want. The same thing happens with Gallo and large wineries.

As to the answer to how they keep the same yeast the same year after year. You can essentially keep yeast forever by deep freezing it. I'm sure they have a vault filled with a library of yeast which they can go back to if they ever need to whip up a batch of new yeast from the original yeast. 

I'll throw this in there too, that the taste of the major brands has evolved over the years. The Budweiser your great grandfather drank in the 1950s probably doesn't taste like the product you get now.

6410,2,,2016-11-30T11:40:40.567,5,,"Clear Absinthe

Absinthe is made much in the same way that many gins are.  You take neutral spirits, add botanicals (wormwood and anise), and re-distill.  Anything that comes out of the still will be clear.  Some absinthes at this point are finished, these will be called blanche (white) or sometime la bleue.  The first absinthe available in Val-de-Travers (the birthplace of absinthe) after the ban in Switzerland was lifted was a blanche.  That same bottling was the driving force behind making it legal in the United States (interview of lawyer who fought the ban).  It can be really good stuff.  Any of these can be really easily colored.

Green Absinthe

Usually absinthe gets a second chance to mingle (macerate) with some herbs after it's sprung from the still, this style is known at verte.  This is when it gets it's color, as well as some extra flavor and aroma. It's a more complex flavor.  The color that the chlorophyll imparts is dull.  If it's neon green there was food coloring added and some of these ""greener"" varieties are actually blanche at heart.  Also of note is that sometimes these food colored types add sugar, to make it friendlier to less experienced drinkers (or to hide poor distillation technique as happens with vodka).  There is at least one non-green bottling that I know of that is still macerated post distillation, but uses hibiscus which turns it red.  These methods of coloration don't make them any less of a true absinthe, they do use wormwood (and equally important, anise).

Czech Absinth (without the e)

The most common non-green ""absinthe"" is so called Czech-style, also known as Bohemian style.  These are not rightly called absinthe and are historically known for very low quality.  Instead of distilling the botanicals in the alcohol, they are cold compounded.  It's made either by mixing spirits, flavoring oils, and food coloring or by macerating the botanicals without distillation.  Be wary of absinthes much over 140 proof, as they are frequently Czech-style.  Do be aware that they're called Czech-style because that's where the style originated and where most of this variety still comes from, however the Czech Republic does have good examples of absinthe.

In most cases, the yeast will be limited by either -


Fermentable sugars already being depleted (not all sugars are readily fermentable to brewing yeasts)
Alcohol levels (this is the waste product of yeast) reaching levels that are toxic to the strain of yeast, and they either die or go dormant


Your typical home brew will go through fermentations so case #1 applies, and then they add just a bit of corn sugar and bottle so just a bit more fermentation occurs to carbonate the beverage in the bottle.

Other bottle conditioned brews might do an estimate of how much sugars have been used and how much remain, by measuring the specific gravity of the beer (more dense with sugars, less dense with less sugar and alcohol instead).

If their calculations were off, and there was still more sugars that could ferment, then pressure would build beyond what was needed just to carbonate.

I had a batch of stout where the yeast culture I used was pretty old, so it was less active than usual.  The time when I thought it was done fermenting was actually not accurate because of the less lively activity, and my bottles of stout all started exploding in my basement, and I had to dump the rest of the batch out to save the bottles.

I also had a fruit punch recipe that my uncle used for a wedding beverage, using just fruit juice, wine and champagne.  He used a much better champagne than the recipe called for, so there was live yeast.  When he put the leftovers back into the wine jugs and put them in the fridge, they got very ""lively"", with carbonation, more alcohol content, a bit drier, and one jug shattering from the additional fermentation.

Eau-de-vie means different things in different places but, in France (where St. Germain hails from) it basically means any distillate. I'd venture to say, since St. Germain refuses to specify, that it's actually a blend of unaged fruit brandys. If this is the case, it almost certainly includes pear (who's distillate is pretty popular in France).... and if you mix grapes and strawberries (both grown in France) you can come close to something approximating lychee (which I doubt they would ship in). The addition of the elderflower would push the grape/strawberry even closer in that lychee direction. This is all just speculation, a whimsy to kick around over a cocktail. 

Realistically, I'd pick up a bottle of high quality syrup (Monin is popular), and use that to replace the liqueur. You want to use less in the cocktail as it's sweeter, but it'll bear the brunt of the work.  You can add a cheap neutral vodka (like Smirnoff) to thin it out if you like. Don't use water to cut it, it'll change the mouthfeel and water down your cocktail. For further experimentation you can use a combination of pear brandy or schnapps (really anything clear and pear flavored) and vodka, I'd start with two parts vodka to one part pear. You'll want to mix the two because otherwise the pear will likely be too strong. Consider garnishing with an orange or lemon twist to replace the citrus in the St Germain. I wouldn't worry too much about the lychee side of things, it seems any options would run pricey. Yeah, your mix will be lacking something but, no matter what you do it won't be quite be the real McCoy.... let us know how it turns out. Cheers.

If the flavor sounds unappealing you can put granulated sugar on the lemon in addition to the bitters.

This is why Josep Raventós Fatjó decided to innovate with Xarel.lo from the same vineyard where de la Finca comes from to this day. He understood the great potential of this grape, the mineral structure of our oldest soils and, most importantly, that to become World Class you have to be AUTHENTIC.
  After 150 years CAVA has become a volume-oriented DO lacking geographical distinction in terms of climate and terroir; it also suffers from low viticultural standards.... For this reason, in November 2012 we decided to leave the CAVA DO.
  We believe that we need to create a LOCAL, VITICULTURALLYORIENTED DO with strict controls in order to showcase our wines and help them to be better understood worldwide.

The lid gets clamped on during the boil with squeexe clamps, c-clamps, locking pliers, etc.

A small hole in the lid for insertion of a thermometer, also sealed with bread dough, allows close monitoring of overhead vapor temperature. The overhead temperature indicates the composition of the vapor thus the composition of the condensate/distillate as well.

6452,2,,2016-12-26T19:26:07.023,5,,"Eggnog appears in grocery stores in (at least) the US from late November through early January.  Whether it's specifically a holiday drink or more generally a seasonal one is unclear.  

According to the Wikipedia page, eggnog gained its holiday association in the 18th century in the US:


  The drink crossed the Atlantic to the British colonies during the 18th century. Since brandy and wine were heavily taxed, rum from the Triangular Trade with the Caribbean was a cost-effective substitute.[7] The inexpensive liquor, coupled with plentiful farm and dairy products, helped the drink become very popular in America.[13] When the supply of rum to the newly founded United States was reduced as a consequence of the American Revolutionary War, Americans turned to domestic whiskey, and eventually bourbon in particular, as a substitute.[7] Eggnog ""became tied to the holidays"" when it was adopted in the United States in the 1700s.[11] Records show that the first US President, George Washington, ""...served an eggnog-like drink to visitors"" which included ""...rye whiskey, rum, and sherry.""[14]


The same page notes that a hot version of the drink, Tom and Jerry, is mentioned in two 20th-century Christmas-themed works of fiction, Damon Runyon's 1932 short story ""Dancing Dan's Christmas"" and Yogi Yorgesson's 1949 novelty song ""I Yust Go Nuts at Christmas"".

There's nothing in the ingredients that is especially available during a particular time of year (unlike, say, apple cider), and yet it is not routinely available the rest of the year.  I suspect this is due to combination of (a) a cultural association between eggnog and winter holidays and (b) the perception of a limited market for something with a limited shelf-life -- suppliers have decided that it won't be profitable year-round and instead promote it during a time of year that already has some traditions and anyway is more likely to have parties.

The ethanol concentrations that you need in order to kill bacteria roughly bottom at what you get in whiskey itself.  Drop below 30% or so, and I haven't seen any study that shows any effectiveness as those levels.   

So, while you could potentially cut your whiskey with a little creek water, and after an hour or so have something that was slightly less potent and fairly safe to drink, it won't give you much in the way of what we might generally think of as purified water. For that, you'll need to stick to water purification tablets or a good filter.

Alton Brown agrees:

The word nog was an Old English term for ale, and a noggin was the cup from whence it was drunk.
Although most Americans think of eggnog as something they get out of a milk carton during the two-week period leading up to Christmas, eggnog descends from sack posset, a strong, thick English beverage built upon eggs, milk and either a fortified wine (like Madeira) or ale. It was a highly alcoholic beverage, often served so thick it could be scooped. It was also very much an upper-class tipple, as rich folks were usually the only ones who could procure the proper ingredients.

My own two cents: Would you want an egg and dairy drink--hot or cold--in warm weather? Also, the tendency to get colds in winter may have meant it was made more often during cold months; and, the inclusion of mace and nutmeg is a natural fit for winter-spiced foods.

  ...absinthe languished in exile for nearly a century, a casualty of bad publicity, special-interest lobbies and mythology. That allowed absinthe to become something of an urban legend, something to talk about in whispers, with wide eyes. Much is said about absinthe; very little of that is true.
  
  So let’s clear up a few misconceptions. Absinthe does not make you hallucinate. It is not wildly addictive. It will not cause you to lop off your ear, unless (possibly, on the off-chance) you are a deeply disturbed painter racked by poverty, heartbreak and mental illness. Rather, absinthe is a good drink.
  
  Degas’ famous 1876 painting, L’Absinthe, is a portrait of overindulgence and isolation: a woman slumped over her cafe table in front of an absinthe glass, face gone slack. In 1890, the book “Wormwood: A Drama of Paris” vilified absinthe, portraying the downward spiral that inevitably follows a drink. (Think “Reefer Madness” for fin-de-siècle Paris.) In 1905, a disturbed Swiss man, drunk on absinthe, murdered his entire family. Absinthe didn’t make him do it — any more than a bipolar who hacks up his neighbor after drinking Jamesons has been deranged by Irish whiskey.
  
  Environmental chemist T.A. Breaux, who has studied absinthe for 14 years, explains what led to the drink’s decline. “As absinthe became immensely popular, there was a drive to make it cheaper,” he says. “In urban areas, where they didn’t have a lot of space for distillation equipment, people made absinthes from cheap industrial alcohol, using chemicals that would induce the green color. There were people who had an interest in capitalizing on this, and they failed to make a distinction between these cheaper drinks and real absinthe. It’s a little bit like using Mad Dog as a reason to ban Bordeaux.” http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/absinthe/

  The earliest reference to Epiphany as a Christian feast was in A.D. 361, by Ammianus Marcellinus.


So, it would be pertinent to drink wines made from Italian grapes since the feast was held within the time of the Roman Empire.

More particularly, you might pick a grape variety from a list of ancient grapes from which the Romans, themselves, would have made wine.

Not that it's entirely pertinent to the Feast of Epiphany, but it is apt to say here that, you might purchase your wine here: https://www.epiphanywineco.com/ :)

As far as my quick and limited research has gone, there really isn't an 'official' wine of the feast - not really a Christian concept to have ""official alcoholic beverages,"" imho.

As far as local traditions, the wiki you linked covers the traditions of the feast internationally but again, alcohol consumption doesn't really ever seem to be the focus...

Also, let's not forget that the Roman's would have had beer at this feast...

  Tibb’s Eve. Tipp’s Eve. Tip’s Eve. Even Tipsy Eve. It doesn’t matter what you call it – it’s December 23rd in Newfoundland and it’s time to have a drink.
  
  Every year on the eve of Christmas Eve people in Newfoundland get the party started. Family and friends are home from the mainland and that calls for a tipple or two. Downtown is on wheels and it’s usually a good time to catch a show. All the best bands have gigs on the go. But how did this yearly party night begin?
  
  In the lead up to the holidays, Advent is a sober, religious time of year. It’s all about prepping and waiting for the celebration. Denying yourself so that you can really give’r when the big day arrives. By the time Christmas actually rolls around, the good people of Newfoundland are jonesing for a drink. It used to be that they would wait until Christmas Day to imbibe but sometime in the mid-20th century people had had enough and made up the holiday of Tibb’s Eve as an excuse to crack open the bottle two days early.
  
  Why Tibb’s Eve?
  
  Why Tibb? The word is archaic slang for a promiscuous woman. Tibb was often used as the name of a loose-moraled woman in 17th century English plays – she was often the comic relief. Adults could refer to Saint Tibb, knowing it would go over the heads of kids, who thought she was a real saint. Tibb’s Eve: A Newfoundland Thing

  Static Clings are usually made of a flexible vinyl or plastic that has a very smooth coat and will stick to clean glass surfaces utilizing the moisture in the air and on the glass to adhere to the surface. In cold weather and dry climates static clings tend to dry up, freeze and then fall off easily. The vinyl material will not retain its ""cling"" abilities for more than a year or two depending on the conditions where the cling is exposed. Some static cling options can be refreshed with soap and water, which is great for long-term use. Static Clings may need a custom quote.&lt;

6484,2,,2017-01-11T00:52:20.037,0,,"It's been a long time since I originally asked this question. While my contributing answer here doesn't really clear up why draught beer (maybe, maybe doesn't) taste better than bottled beer, two things are clear to me now after spending a lot of time reflecting on the difference:

One

As Tom pointed out in the very first comment, drinking beer (and coffee too, for that matter!) out of a small spout (bottle, travel mug, etc.) blocks your nose from inhaling the aromas of the beer. This limits the amount of flavour you can sense. Pouring the bottled beer into a glass dramatically improves its flavour because the open mouth of the glass allows you to taste and smell.

Two

There's an inverse relationship between perceived ""better"" taste and the volume of bottles a brewery produces (and how far they intend to distribute). 

Beer brewed at a local microbrew has a shelf-life of only a few weeks on the outside; preservatives are limited or omitted and their ingredients are typically fresh, with a comparably short self-life. 

Larger breweries distribute further distances, demand a longer shelf-life, and usually have a need to maintain a consistent taste across their entire production line and the resulting shelf-life. These breweries use high-volume equipment (an increase in the amount the beer is processed) and high-volume ingredients (preservatives in ingredients make them last longer, but may not be fresh). It also becomes increasingly difficult to quality-control when mass-producing —  these breweries are less likely to take risks, and they rely on machinery to achieve consistency, often sacrificing quality. 

tl;dr: draught beer, like micro-brewed beer was never intended to last for months or years on the shelf, and thus preservatives don't need to be factored into the production, and the beer is liable to be fresher more flavourful.

One last bonus point

I've also noticed that at times, bottled microbrews, poured into a glass can actually taste better than their draught counterparts. Go figure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

White should be served at a lower temperature than cellar temperature. Red wine, ideally, should be served at cellar temperature. What is the ideal cellar temperature? That is open to debate, but somewhere in the low 50s Fahrenheit (about 11-12 C). Humidity should be kept constant around 75% but there is no evidence you need to keep the humidity that high. You do not want to keep it at an excessively low humidity. You are trying to make sure the corks don't dry out which can cause wine leaking around the cork. You also want as little light and vibration as possible. Think of a cave as your ideal storage facility. You can read the Wikipedia article about Wine Storage

-Schwarzbier: or black beer, is a dark lager made in Germany

Dark Beer: opaque or near-opaque colour that exists with stouts, porters, schwarzbiers (black beer) and other deeply coloured styles

6498,2,,2017-01-30T15:53:06.937,5,,"Porters and Stouts were similar but different... in the beginning. I'm going to try my best to paraphrase this wonderful article, some of the BJCP Guidelines, and this article.

Porters (have #s) Stouts (have bullet points)



A substantial, malty dark ale with a complex and flavorful roasty character.




A very dark, roasty, bitter, creamy ale.


These are the BJCP definitions - note... they're fairly similar


Originally, just your &quot;common&quot; brown beer.




Originally, just a &quot;stout&quot; (or stronger) brown beer.


Already... you can probably see why people use them interchangeably


Origin for Porters are credited to London.




Stouts are credited with originating in Ireland.


Apparently, water (which, as odd as it seems, is the most unique thing to beers!) and science played a large part in London's success in creating Porters instead of porter being a generic brown beer. Science revealed that the efficiency of the brown grains was 2/3 of pale malt. Even though brown malt was cheaper than pale, the horrible grain efficiency made it more expensive. Therefore the Porter soon had a mixed grain bill using a brown malt base and substituted pale malt for profit. This was made even more apparent when the English Government/Parliament/forgive my idiocy on the verbage here started taxing beer.
Later- London started using a method known as &quot;parti-gyling&quot;... per the first link:

Parti-gyling isn’t what you think it is. Almost all modern descriptions get it badly wrong. It isn’t—after 1800 at least—using the first runnings to make one beer and the second and third for others.  It’s much more sophisticated than that.


Porter brewers mashed several times. The worts from each mash were hopped and boiled separately, then blended to produce whatever beers were required. Two, three or even four beers were assembled from blends of each of the worts.


It’s a very efficient way of making not just huge volumes of a beer, but also relatively small amounts of stronger beers. Or any amount of any strength beer. With their brew lengths of hundreds of barrels, London’s porter brewers couldn’t brew the strongest Stouts single-gyle. The amount they could sell would barely have covered the false bottoms of their massive mash tuns.


That’s why they often parti-gyled their stouts with porter. You can probably see where this is going. The recipes for porter and stout were, by definition, identical, as they were brewed together.
(Sorry I couldn't paraphrase this part... it all seemed relevant.)

So... it seems that all Stouts are Porters; but, not all Porters are Stouts (think squares and rectangles).
As far as Schwarzbier goes - this is a LAGER where Porters and Stouts are ALES.  I also differentiate between ales and lagers in this post. In the homebrewing world, there was a fad of black-lagers/ales a few years ago. The grain used in brewing was more or less burnt in order to give the pale ale a dark appearance but taste/feel like a pale ale/lager.
Dark beer is just a classification of all of these types.
Here is a link to the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) that has links to what each beer type should taste/look like.

Yeah it's probably okay for hobby brewers, but for anyone actually interested in solving the problem for example use in software design or higher ABV products, this approximation is really not good enough. 

This is actually a ridiculously complicated subject and it all boils down to the fact that at a molecular level, water and ethanol interact with one another with what are known as hydrogen bonds. Now you can just use an empirical lookup table or regress a tonne of data, but if you're interested in the root of this problem you should do some research into what are known as equations of state. In particular UNIQUAC for ethanol-water mixtures. It get's even worse when you realise that these equations of state describe gaseous behaviour remarkably well, but require additional thought to be applied to liquids. 

People dedicate their entire lives into perfecting a generalised equation of state to describe the interactions between all chemical components. ANYWAY I digress... 

I've done some number crunching myself using UNIQUAC and have come up with the following simple formula. Like yours above, it's only applicable to ethanol-water mixtures, and I've only validated this equation up to an ABV of 50% so be weary of going higher. This equation has an R-Squared value of 1. 

ABW = 0.1893*ABV*ABV + 0.7918*ABV + 0.0002

6500,2,,2017-01-30T17:47:15.013,1,,"As noted in Xander's ♦ answer, it is a cultural reason as to why both France and Italy have such a lower beer consumption than their neighbors?
The answer would be all too simple to say it is because they can. 

Not only is it a cultural thing, it may have an historical cultural reason. The top wine producing countries are Italy, France followed by Spain. The reason why Spain produces less wine and beer may be due to its' drier climate.


  Spain produces about 5 billion bottles of wine annually and is actually home to the largest number of vineyards of any European country. However, its vineyards are more spread out and produce smaller yields than vineyards in France or Italy due to the drier soil common in many wine-growing regions of Spain. Although more than 400 varieties of grapes are grown in Spain, just 20 of those account for nearly 90% of all Spanish wine production. - The 4 Countries that Produce the Most Wine 


Why Italy and France produces less beer and yet more wine may be due to the influence of its' Catholic heritage. Both France and Italy have strong roots with Catholicism and the Holy See. Italy was once the home of the Papal States (8th century - 1870) and France was home the papacy during the Western Schism. We must keep in mind that for Catholics wine is absolutely necessary for their liturgy.

In fact the Vatican is at the top of the list of wine drinking nations.


  Vatican City is at the very top of the wine-drinking league with an average resident consuming an impressive 54.26 liters a year. Although it may seem surprising that the Holy See grabs top spot, it does have a uniform and unusual demographic. Its residents are older and tend to eat together in large groups while the consumption of Communion wine is standard practice for a large proportion of them. Andorra, another small European nation, is in second place with 46.26 liters consumed per capita. France places fifth, with residents drinking 42.5 liters of wine each year.

I do not mean this as a repeat of this question. I am interested in the reasons bars, specifically, might wish to have and serve from firkins, and not just the general difference in beer varieties.

I understand there is a historical nature to this, which might be amusing for some purposes. But I want to know if there are specific effects on the beer itself: storage timing, retention of flavor, temperature needs, pouring effect (slower, no CO2, whatever), and so on. 

If the bar offered the exact same beer, one in a cask and one on a regular tap, should there be noticeable differences in the resulting served beer?

6502,2,,2017-01-30T20:26:10.543,1,,"So... the short answer is novelty... and possibly, less beer loss per firkin if the CO2 is causing the beer to be head-y and a lot of beer gets wasted when bartenders pour through the foam.  

The more complex answer is - as long as a beer is in a metal firkin... there should be no discerning difference in quality/taste/etc. The difference would come in the form of wooden firkins. If, for example, you had a Stout on tap and the same stout served in a wooden firkin, the longer the beer stayed in the wooden firkin, the more the flavors would change. Especially if the wooden firkin was previously used to make a spirit (like bourbon).  

If the latter - bourbon barrrel - the longer the beer stays in, the more of the bourbon flavor shines through.

Generally, in the northern hemisphere, you cannot make quality wine above the 50th parallel. It simply starts to get too cold to grow grapes that get ripe enough for wine. OTOH, you can grow barley just about anywhere. So, why did they choose wine over beer then? The other reason why wine is the preferred drink where you can grow grapes is that beer goes bad quickly and does not transport easily. Whereas, wine can be stored a long time and transported long distances (we are of course talking about ancient history). So, given a choice, our ancestors usually choose wine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Bulldog Mexicana

The Mexican Bulldog Margarita, simply put, is a margarita joined by a bottle of Corona--in the same glass. Specifically, that glass should be large enough to handle a margarita and a beer. To make this specialty, all that's needed is one ounce of your favorite tequila (if you add an extra splash, we won't tell). You'll also need lime margarita mix and any other margarita fixings you like such as salt around the rim and a juicy slice of lime. Mix up your margarita as you normally would. When it's complete, you will invert the bottle of Corona into the glass allowing the golden beer to combine with the cocktail. The result is quite extraordinary. Many people love the way the beer cuts down on some of the cocktail's sweetness. Others simply love the punch it packs. Because this drink is actually two drinks combined in one glass, you may want to take it easy on ordering a second or add some crushed ice to the glass!

Keep It Classic: The Black Velvet

Featuring one-part Guinness and one-part brut sparkling wine, the Black Velvet is a London-born beer cocktail that first wowed pub goers in 1861. The drink was actually created to help mourn the loss of Queen Victoria's consort, Prince Albert. Champagne is traditionally the sparkling wine of choice but others may be substituted. Serve this half and half beverage in a stout beer glass and you may then enjoy its Victorian charms.

Keep it Light: the Cuban Bul

If you're not in the mood for the heavy Black Velvet, try the refreshing spritzer-like Cuban Bul. You'll need a 12-oz can of light beer (choose something crisp), a 12 oz can of ginger ale, two tablespoons of sugar (or to taste), and a third of a cup of lime juice (go for freshly squeezed). Mix the ingredients along with some crushed ice in a glass, taste, and discover your new favorite cocktail; it's a winner and you'll be amazed at how light and delicious it tastes!

Most people don't pair straight spirits with foods as most (self injected word) people reading websites for pairings drink spirits in &quot;cocktail&quot; format.
Information from the website includes:
RYE

Faile recommends pouring rye to cut through the high fat content of fattier charcuterie options. &quot;The tannins and natural spices come through in a rye,&quot; he explains, &quot;and a higher proof (100 or higher) is perfect for complementing something fatty and smoked.&quot;

BOURBON

bourbon naturally complements smoky flavors, but the added dimension of sweetness can come in handy. &quot;Bourbons pair with the same principle as spicy foods paired with Riesling,&quot; says Faile. &quot;The sweetness of the bourbon tempers the heat from spice so the heat does not become the only note. A wheated bourbon coats the tongue to allow the spice to come through with each bite rather than building up.&quot;

SCOTCH

&quot;The peatiness of Scotch makes it a perfect match for smoked meats, &quot; says Anda. &quot;German style sausages, like landjäger, are great with Scotch because they're smoked with immense depth of flavor and not overly fatty.&quot;
But finding the right charcuterie match can be a bit of a moving target depending on how the spirit is finished. A sherry-barrel aged Scotch like Bowmore 15, accents peat flavors with a sweetness that Faile says can be great with saltier charcuterie.

GIN

&quot;Being all herbal and floral,&quot; Faile explains, &quot;gin doesn't require fat to balance its flavors.&quot; Instead, the charcuterie flavors to look for when thinking of pairings for gin, says Faile, &quot;are botanical more than fat.&quot; Herbs like fennel and thyme are key points for pairing. &quot;Porchetta's are often seasoned with fennel and citrus,&quot; Anda says, pointing to one delicious option. Anda also recommends duck prosciutto, which he describes as more oily than fatty and is often cured with herbs, or a finocchiona, a fennel salami

AMARO

Along the same lines as gin, amaro's earthy, herbaceous, and citrus qualities give it pairing versatility. Faile recommends trying earthy Averna with a liverwurst, or herbaceous Fernet with a bresaola or speck.

  Wild duck, goose, partridge and pheasant meat is very aromatic and is paired with stronger, aromatic wines in comparison with the wines paired with domestic poultry. Choice of wine depends on the age of the bird and its preparation.
  
  Young roasted partridge or a pheasant has a less intense flavor compared to older birds so light red wine such as Shiraz or Chianti would be appropriate. If the meat is prepared with thyme, then a more mature red Burgundy would be more appropriate. - Learn about wild game wine pairings

Chaptilization is permitted in only certain areas of France. Those are Bordeaux, Burgundy, Alsace and Champagne. There is no need in warmer climates where the grapes get higher brix (sugar levels)

No it's not dangerous to consume chaptilized wine. The main reason is to bring a wine up to around 11-12 potential alcohol so the wine is stable and in balance. Cool climate places like Germany and France routinely have under ripe grapes and sometimes need a little help getting across the finish line. 

If done in moderation, all the sugar added will be consumed by yeast and turned into alcohol. I suppose you could go crazy and make a wine with so much sugar it wouldn't finish fermenting. Some people swear they can tell when a wine has added sugar, but as far as I know, nobody can really tell by tasting if done in moderation.

Why is it banned in the warmer places like California, Australia and South Africa? There simply isn't a need. The grapes get ripe on their own. 

There is one big loophole to get around this, you can use grape juice concentrate to give you an added boost if you are in bad (cool) year. But for the most part if you are looking at a crappy and cool year, say in California, you might just buy grapes from a warmer location and do some blending.

You might get a more intense taste of the wine if you could take more of it into your mouth and ""wash"" with it. Even more if you take a sip, wash, gulp/spit, take another sip and taste.

Maybe you want to try it, when you drink a glass of wine next time and then decide if the bigger sips / double sipping makes a difference to you.

If it does but you dislike the idea of a spitoon, try reducing the number of wines per evening, so the increasing intoxication is not a problem.

I really like your version of private tastings and might adopt some ideas from it. Have fun!

6532,2,,2017-02-14T16:57:21.670,7,,"We need to work up a few definitions before we get to the final answer here.  So without further ado:

Single Malt

Single Malt means that the whiskey has been made using ONLY malted barley and nothing else and has been distilled at a single distillery.  This is to distinguish it from:

Grain/Single Pot

Grain Whiskey, called Single Pot or Pure Pot when it's Irish, is still whiskey from a single distillery but can have other grains in it, such as rye or unmalted barley.

Single Malt + Single Malt = Blended/Vatted Malt

By mixing single malts from different distilleries you get a Blended Malt or Vatted Malt whiskey.

Single Malt + Grain Whiskey = Blended Whiskey

When you mix Single Malt with anything besides more Single Malt you get regular old Blended whiskey.



A lot of these terms only really apply to whiskies produced outside of the US, namely Scotland and Ireland, but Japan's whiskey-producing traditions are based primarily on Scotland's.

In the US the whole malt thing goes out the window since the legal requirements only specify ""Majority"" grains, IE American Malt Whiskey only needs to be 51% malted barley.  Rye Malt is 51% malted rye, etc.  But the US terms also put a lot of other restrictions on the length of time the whiskey was aged and the alcohol proof at after distillation, when put into barrels, and when bottled.  But that's a different question.

6533,2,,2017-02-14T17:26:11.217,4,,"Yes the same beer from a cask and a keg will be VERY different.

To your first point, breweries and bars will often have specially treated casks in ways that are impossible to do with kegs.  Stuff like dry-hopping the beer in the cask at the bar so it's at its freshest and most intense.  With a keg you'd need to put this between the tap and the glass like a Randall but with a cask you can just pop the cap and shove whatever you want in there.

Casked beer also generally still have active yeast in it, at least according to CAMRA's rules, while kegs are filtered and have no yeast in them.  Because of this there's a lot of preparation involved in a proper real ale cask.


The cask will come sealed from the brewery.  First a soft spile or peg must be driven into the top hole.  This is just a porous plug that allows air out.  Based on how foamy this gets the bar can see how active the yeast is.
When the yeast dies down the soft spile gets replaced with a hard spile which stops gas exchange.  The cask then has to sit for a while so all the yeast can fall to the bottom as well as any other particulates or large proteins in the beer.  This is called ""Dropping Bright""
Finally, once the beer has dropped bright the cask can be tapped which involves removing the hard spile and also either hooking up the side hole to a beer engine or a simple tap.


Because of all this and traditionally being served from a cellar or bartop at ""cellar temperature"" vs kegs which are refrigerated the beer that comes out will be slightly warmer (40-50F vs 30-40F), much slower because of the pumping and off-gassing from the pour, and way less carbonated.  Some beer engines will also use ""sparkler"" taps that fizz up the beer even more on the way out to generate more head but also results in a less carbonated beer.

The result is a beer that will generally be smoother and rounder, you may get more flavor and more sweetness since it's warmer.  Some flavors will come out more in the warmer and less carbonated and some will be overshadowed.  Mouthfeel will be affected a lot by both factors as well.  It's a hugely different animal and sometimes people like it.

6534,2,,2017-02-14T23:08:35.393,3,,"It's fairly common in the wine trade to spit wine when evaluating wine as a buyer, winemaker, sommelier because you will get trashed if you drank everything.

So there are two ways to spit. There is the common spit ""bucket"" and the paper coffee cup methods. When I taught at our local community college, they had every student spit wine into white paper coffee cups. Some people don't want to touch a common spit bucket and not everyone one is good at spitting with precision, so I recommend the coffee cup approach for beginners. You should see real professionals, they can spit into a bucket from 20 feet!

There is a technique to it that takes a little bit of mastery so you don't end up dribbling wine all down your chin and clothes, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy.

Cite from Wikipedia:

Some canned beers are pressurized by adding liquid nitrogen, which vaporises and expands in volume after the can is sealed, forcing gas and beer into the widget's hollow interior through a tiny hole - the less beer the better for subsequent head quality.
[...]
When the can is opened, the pressure in the can quickly drops, causing the pressurised gas and beer inside the widget to jet out from the hole. This agitation on the surrounding beer causes a chain reaction of bubble formation throughout the beer. The result, when the can is then poured out, is a surging mixture in the glass of very small gas bubbles and liquid.

Even a vodka that is supposedly easier on your liver (because you know.... science and stuff) only goes for 30 dollars. 

On the luxury end of the spectrum vodka tops out around 70 bucks. This includes a numbered, limited edition bottle, that uses potato vintages in the same way that wines use grape vintages, and even lists the name of the potato farmer on the label. There are some notable and pricey exceptions to that. Stolichnaya released three limited edition bottlings a few years back, each going for 3k. The big deal with these was that they used special water sources. When you go for ultra-premium vodka, that's what you get.... really expensive water.

If you are still interested, Subzero in St. Louis was named one of the best vodka bars in America by both USA Today and Liquor.com.

Personally, whether this is a gift or you just want to try something different, here are a few things that might interest you. Napa Reserve Neutral Brandy is vodka made from wine.

It was the first vodka made from milk and if I remember right, a couple years back I could swear I heard it was Prince Williams favored vodka. Then again, apparently a bottle of Smirnoff was seen at Kensington Palace... and if the cheap stuff is good enough for royalty, it should be good enough for anyone.

  Columella's Caciofiore can be considered a sort of ""ancestor"" of the Roman Pecorino Cheese, prepared with rennet based on cardoon. Columella talks about this cheese in his treatise ""De Rustica"": ""It is better to curdle the milk with lamb or kid rennet, although it is also possible to curdle it with the cardoon flower or with safflower seeds or fig latex. Anyway, the best cheese is made with as less treatment as possible"". (Lucio Giunio Moderato Columella, ""De Rustica"", 50 AD). Today, in the Roman Countryside, ""native country"" of the cardoon and the artichoke, some producers still use the cardoon flower as rennet and prepare raw milk pecorino cheese with an ancient taste. 


The Chianti red wine could be substituted with a Sangiovese red wine.

If the olives or spices are over powering the taste of your dish you may wish to use a Merlot Wine.

If it is a fortified wine you are after, would like to recommend a fortified Madeira Wine.


  Fortified wines, like port, sherry and Madeira, also go very well with rich cheeses. A classic match is English Stilton and port, but other blue cheeses also taste lovely alongside a glass of sweet, flavourful port. - Pairing red wine with cheese.

6577,2,,2017-02-23T09:28:13.100,2,,"The beer called Guinness draft in Ireland would be called Guinness On Tap in locations such as New York.  

The reason for the emphasis on draft versus in bottle is quality and taste. 
In my experience over recent decades, people pay extra for the most popular bottled beers in the US and in my opinion this is because of the guaranteed quality of bottled. Depending on the bar, the draft (tap) beer can vary from OK to well, stale, or watery, or even unhealthy in some disreputable cases. 
The bottle is much more tamper-proof.  So for this reason people will pay a couple of dollars more per drink for the same volume, of the same brand.
Having said that, your large volume commercial US (and European) beers are mostly lagers, pilsners and the like.  For these kinds of beer, the difference between bottled and high quality draft in a good bar, is small.

But Guinness stout is a very specific kind of brew.  As a variant of porter, it provides a very different experience from the bottle versus on draft.
It is very rare to see anyone in Ireland drink bottled Guinness (or any other brand of stout) in their local pub. Compared to draft, the bottled tastes bitter, is gassy and does not keep the creamy head to anything like the same extent as well served draft. In contrast, a good pint of draft stout is creamy, the maltiness well balanced with hops.  Try a taste comparison and you will see for yourself. 

But have it in a reputable pub in Ireland.  There the supply chain is quality assured and the bartender is well drilled in the pour, which is also unique to draft stout.

6581,2,,2017-02-23T16:19:07.900,2,,"A rule of thumb, one shot of high proof is like two shots of an average liquor. It'll still be stronger but, you can wing recipes by halving the alcohol.

When working with high proofs the trick is achieving proper dilution. Somewhere in the range of 20 percent ABV is a noble choice for a finished cocktail. Often you may want more than 20 percent (even up to 40 percent which is like taking straight shots, easy does it) rarely you'll want less. For a bottle sitting at 96 percent, a 1:4 ratio (booze:mixer) should put you around 19 percent while 3:7 will up you to 28 percent.

Since you don't have to add much spirit to your drink, you can add it to things without changing their mouth texture or flavor too much so, they're good for keeping thick or rich fluids just the way you like them. In my experience, these high proofs don't have much flavor to start with but they do have more bite or burn than say, a good vodka. I would keep the vodka for lighter flavors like lemonade but, this might work just fine for orange juice. I think something like this would make a good candidate for a boozy shake, if that's the route you go I recommend pulling that ABV down past that 20 percent, closer to 12 or 15 percent (where most wine sits at) because milkshakes are big... nobody wants a tiny milkshake.

Fair warning, if your mixer is a liqueur.... if it has alcohol in it, the math below won't work. Don't mix 141 or 160 or 192 proof alcohol with nothing but Bailey's and then wonder why you blacked out, you have to add more non-alcoholic liquid to offset the extra alcohol....

Now for the math. I got those ratios up there by taking the ABV and multiplying it by decimals. So... a bottle with 96 percent ABV, if you multiply 96 by 0.5 you get 48, your new ABV. That 0.5 represents how much of your original alcohol is added to the mix. 0.5 is half alcohol and half mixer. 0.2 is 2 parts alcohol to 8 parts mixer. 0.3 is 3 parts alcohol to 7 parts mixer... notice how the ratios always add up to ten. You can do this with any ABV. If I wanted to mix with a 40 percent ABV just start playing with numbers. 40 ABV x .7 = 28 ABV in a 7 part alcohol to 3 part mixer ratio.

What an item fetched at auction last week may have no bearing on what you might be able to buy it for today (possibly it would be literally priceless), and no bearing on what it might sell for tomorrow if it went to auction again.

Who knows what Thomas Jefferson's Chateau Lafite 1787 would sell for if it came up for auction now (it sold in 1985 for $160,000).

If you restrict it to something you can actually buy now at retail, I think it would be tough to beat the 50 year old Balvenie (~£30,000) or 50 year old Macallan Lalique (~£50,000 if available?), but prices will be highly retailer dependent.

Novelty bar drinks will probably be more expensive by volume, if anybody actually pays for them... but if you disqualify Diamond Is Forever from the Ritz-Carlton in Tokyo ($22,600) since you're paying for a $16,000 diamond inside the drink itself, and also disqualify drinks with any precious materials other than the liquids themselves (e.g. The Gigi from Gigi's at Mayfair for £8,888 gets you a bit of gold leaf) and further disqualify ""profits go to charity""-type drinks (you can taste the Macallan Cire Perdue¹ for $64,000 at the £10 bar (lol) of Montage Beverly Hills hotel), you're probably left with whatever made-for-publicity drink currently holds the record. That might be  Salvatore's Legacy at £5,500 from Playboy Club in Mayfair... but at this point, does it really matter? The prices would seem to just be part of the gimmick and a way of keeping score.

To try to answer the ""why"" part of the question explicitly, a price is only reflective of value to the extent that both a buyer and a seller can agree to transact at it. A ticket price only indicates willingness on a seller's part, and shouldn't be taken as evidence that it can in fact ""command"" that price. That said, while production costs (including storage, wastage, and opportunity costs) are a big reason why older wines and spirits tend to cost more, at the top end, rarity and perceived prestige will also play a big part. At auctions, though, most of it will come down to a few people with money who all want something of which only one exists. It's similar to how a print of what to my admittedly philistine eyes looks like a boring photograph of a not-particularly-pretty section of river can sell for millions.

Allow me to have a little fun here and show you how to modify a cocktail recipe and I will use Cocoroco as an example. But first:

Alcohol Percentages of Cocktails
When creating a new cocktail, balance is always important. A common rookie mistake is to make a cocktail that has the alcohol content way out of proportion. You know, the one that should actually have the flammable symbol on the side of the glass. Five ounces of Everclear (95% ABV), one-ounce orange juice! The idea being that; it may not taste good, but it will get you “;wasted”. Well, we’ve all done that and realized that there are better ways to enjoy the benefits of alcohol. The best way is in a well-balanced cocktail.
The best example of a balanced drink is wine. It has a moderate alcohol content and the sweet and sour balance each other out nicely. The alcohol content of a standard glass of wine is around 12% with some wines approaching 14%. Some ports and sherry have alcohol content in the 17% to 20% range, and still taste very good, usually because the sugar content is higher. Again, it’s all about balance in drinks.

The full article on from the Art of Drink, explains how to figure out the math percentages in drinks in a very simple manner and will leave it to the reader to investigate this further on there own.
Now turning to Cocoroco.

The Cocoroco is the most alcoholic beverage in the world. With a graduation around 96 degrees this Bolivian drink can be highly toxic.  It is made from sugarcane.
The locals often mixed with tea and lemon. It is a drink used primarily to remove the cold at these altitudes is considerable.

Here I will modify the Crazy Parrot Cocktail Recipe calling it Bolivian Naval Destroyer. Bolivia is a landlocked country, but it still possesses a navy.
The following is only an example of how I would modify a drink in order to be able to use a very high percentage alcohol in a mix.
Bolivian Naval Destroyer:

I'd avoid lighter or delicate / floral spirits, since they don't really work (for me) with a deep dark chocolate.

Several years ago, I witnessed a stewardess spill some wine one a lady's dress while on route to England. The first thing she did was apologize and then got the head stewardess involved. The lady got her drink renewed on the spot, plus the airline gave her accommodations (hotel) at the airport to cleanup, have her clothes washed and dry cleaned, and so on, all on KLM's bill. 

Here are some commonsense rules to follow when you spill someone's drink over as follows, (if it is simply a question of spill a drink): 


  1) Avoid letting the situation happen in the first place. You are most likely to spill someone's drink when you are making magnanimous gestures, carrying a few drinks of your own, or if you are feeling buzzed. So remember to be observant at these high risk moments. If you do spill someone's drink, do not ignore it, but act quickly to assess the situation and defuse any hostile vibrations. 
  
  2) Apologize. If you have just spilled someone's drink, you should apologize immediately and unreservedly. If they are a decent type, this should stop them from getting too agitated.
  
  3) Considering buying a replacement. Have a look at the damage. If you have just knocked their drink out of their hands all over the floor, then you need to replace it immediately. If you've only knocked an ounce of beer or two from the top of their glass, then it shouldn't be a big deal. 
  
  •Most people will be okay about it, and no replacement drink should be required. If they become confrontational, it would be best just to buy them a drink to save you the trouble. -

  The worm is reserved for a drink known as Mezcal, which, according to some, is tequila’s big brother. But the two spirits are entirely different. Tequila is distilled from any number of natural Mexican plants and can bear the name as long as the finished product consists of at least 51% agave. Mezcal must be 100% agave. - Should You Eat the Tequila Worm?


Most people would not eat the mezcal worm, but in some cultures it is quite acceptable.


  There are no proven side effects that come with consuming a Tequila worm. While the worm is popularly called the tequila worm, it is only found on the bottom of a bottle of mezcal, a variety of tequila obtained from distilling blue agave and similar plants. The meriposa worm is grown on agave from which mezcal is made, and when a worm is added to the mezcal, it is known as mezcal con gusano.
  
  Consuming the worm after drinking mezcal is a popular tradition among many communities, but it is not clear where the tradition originated. Some believe that the adding the worm in a bottle of mezcal signifies the purity of the alcohol, as it hinders the disintegration of the worm. Others believe that it is merely a marketing strategy among Mexican liquor producers.
  
  While it's documented in media that the eating the worm causes hallucinations, this has yet to be medically proven. The worm is pickled in alcohol for more than a year and is made sure to be free to pesticides, before being added to mezcal. It is also a popular delicacy in Mexican restaurants, and is said to have positive psychological effects. - What happens when someone eats a Tequila worm?

The red worm, the taster one, is a larva of the moth Comadia Redtenbacheri from the Cossidae family of moths. They both invade agave plants (what tequila and mezcal are made from), which is why those are the worms that go in the bottle.

Choosing whether to eat it or not is entirely up to you. On the one hand, the mezcals that have a worm in the bottle are usually bad. It first appeared in bottles around the 1940's or 50's, likely as a marketing gimmick, so it's not some ancient tradition. Opposed to what some people claim it won't get you drunk, you won't hallucinate, and it won't make you horny. The booze is good enough at that stuff anyway. On the other hand, it does actually change the mezcal's chemistry so you can't prove it's in there only for marketing. Both types of worm are eaten even when they aren't alcohol soaked, there are worm tacos and sal de gusano (gusano meaning worm so, worm salt). In Naturalis Historia, Pliny the Elder wrote that larvae, fattened up with flour, was one of the most delicate dishes and highly appreciated by Romans. In fact the larvae that Pliny wrote about may be of the same Cossidae family as the red mezcal worm. This book was written around 70 AD.... so there is some ancient history there after all. Most importantly though.... it's kind of fun. You get to say you ate the worm, most people won't. (Chants... dooo it, doooo it, doooo it.)

My first recommendation would be mead. Mead would be a fitting drink to ease the knowledge that tomorrow is the start of the traditional 40 days of fasting.

My second drink would be a nice good bottle of Rauchbier or ""smoke beer"". In today's way of fasting during Lent alcohol is no longer a forbidden food, so any left over could be consumed during Lent.


  Rauchbier, or “smoke beer,” is made using malts that have been dried over fire—-thus gaining the smoky taste of cured meats like ham and bacon. At one time all beers malts were produced over fire, but in medieval Bavaria beers of this type came to be associated with Lent when the rich, smoky tones of meat were dearly missed. There is, of course, an official blessing for beer (“Bless, O Lord, this creature beer . . . ”) which one may safely assume is more efficacious in the original Latin: ” Benedic, Domine, creaturam istam cerevisiae, quam ex adipe frumenti producere dignatus es: ut sit remedium salutare humano generi, et praesta per invocationem nominis tui sancti; ut, quicumque ex ea biberint, sanitatem corpus et animae tutelam percipiant.

Zabaglione is generally thought as sweet, however it can also be made without sugar, using dry wine and egg yolks, thus becoming a fine sauce for fish, chicken or vegetables. It is used this way in French cuisine as well as Italian. 


  In Italy chefs and home cooks often measure the ingredients for zabaglione quite casually. Six egg yolks, for example, would be combined with six egg shells of sugar and 12 of wine or liqueur. Although Marsala is most often used for zabaglione, there is no reason why other wines or liqueurs can't be substituted, depending on the final flavor desired. Italian recipes usually call for dry Marsala. If a sweet wine or liqueur is used, the amount of sugar should be substantially decreased. Grand Marnier, Sauternes, Madeira, oloroso sherry, Southern Comfort, anisette, coffee- flavored liqueurs, Amaretto or La Grande Passion, the new passion- fruit liqueur, are just a few of the possibilities. - ZABAGLIONE, AN ITALIAN DESSERT


Personally, I would not use whiskey or cognac in this dessert. But this is a personal preference. I am impartial to either a blackberry wine or strawberry wine. When I say these particular wines, I mean real blackberry wine and not simply blackberry flavored wine. It makes a difference in my mind. All said and done whiskey can be used in zabaglione and in fact here is an Italian recipe for it. The following is in Italian:


  Sbattete 4 tuorli con 60 g di zucchero, versate a filo 1/2 dl di whisky e cuocete a bagnomaria, montando con una frusta. Montate 1 dl di panna e unitela allo zabaione. Per un'alternativa sprint: Zabov (0,70 litri, 8,50 e). -  Zabaione al whisky.


Angela Hartnett’s zabaglione recipe uses whiskey, brandy and a sweet wine.

Just like wine, whisky demands a reasonable glass that will help rather than hinder the aromas. Avoid shot glasses and wide-mouthed tumblers, and go for something like the Glencairn Whisky Glass, or a tulip glass or even a brandy snifter.
Pour an amount that will let you swirl the whisky without sloshing it. Swirl it to coat the sides, which will allow you to smell it better. Observe the ""legs"", but don't be fooled by superstitions attached to them, they're a consequence of the Marangoni Effect (fascinating video).
Stick your nose over the glass's opening and inhale very gingerly. Avoid knocking your smell receptors out. Save the deep breaths for after step 5.
(optional) Take a tiny sip (again save your enthusiasm for after you have tasted it diluted, or you risk numbing your taste and smell receptors), and just like wine, let it run over all of your tongue, and like wine ""chew"" it to allow the air you are intaking to bring the aromas and flavors to the back of your nose. 
Drink some water and possibly eat something neutral. Add a few drops of (good quality) water to the whisky, try to take the ABV to around 35%ish.
Stick your nose deeper into the glass and smell. I'd still suggest being a little cautious until you learn the glasses and your nose. It would be a pity to numb yourself at this stage.
Take a sip, let it run all over your tongue. ""Chew"" it... Savor it.


Try to learn something about the whisky you are drinking and associate how it was made with what you are tasting. Was it peated? Is it kept by the sea? What type of oak is used? How old is it? All these things will drastically affect the flavor.

If you are drinking the whisky to taste it, please do not skip step 5 (Note 1, Note 2, Note 3, Note 4). You can always decide you prefer a whisky undiluted afterwards. 

In a similar vein, you can decide you prefer ice after tasting it properly, despite Note 4's suggestions. By all means drink how you want to drink, but adding ice is prone to both over-cool the whisky (diminishing and changing its flavors) and also over-dilute it. Optimal temperature and strength will vary by whisky and by drinker's preferences (and season, etc.), but I'd aim to start your investigations at around 15-20C and around 30-35%.

6620,2,,2017-03-01T11:05:17.653,3,,"Some tips:


Protect your bottles from sunlight and extreme temperatures. 
If your bottles have cork tops, make sure to keep the corks moist so that they don't disintegrate (just turning the bottles upside down every month or so for a few seconds does wonders). 
As the level in each bottle drops, consider transferring the contents to a smaller bottle. This prevents volatiles from leaving the liquid and also excludes oxygen from the bottle (though whether you're mixing in extra oxygen during the transfer is perhaps a worry). If you know beforehand that you will take your time on a certain bottle, I'd rebottle it at the outset.
If you already own it for wine (or are otherwise serious about keeping half-empty bottles for a long time), you could also use something like an inert gas wine preserver (e.g. PrivatE PreservE or Winesave PRO) to add a layer of what is basically Argon over the liquid. I haven't tried this.


Vermouths and other alcohols ~20% ABV don't keep well for long once opened. Treat them like wine: drink them faster or open fewer of them. They will lose their aromas, then oxidize, and finally turn to vinegar.

Liqueurs with low water activity (read: lots of sugar) will probably stay safe to consume for quite a long time (years), but they are still prone to oxidization leading to off flavors. Re-bottle at the outset if you must, or consume faster, or discard and buy new.

Consider storing your bitters in the fridge.

from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starka

""Starka is a traditional dry vodka distilled from rye grain, currently produced only in Poland and Lithuania. Traditionally Starka is made from natural (up to 2 distillations, no rectification) rye spirit and aged in oak barrels with small additions of linden-tree and apple-tree leaves. The methods of production are similar to those used in making whisky. Sold in various grades, the most notable difference between them is the length of the aging period, varying from 5 to over 50 years, and the natural color which is obtained from the reaction between the alcohol and the oak barrel, not from the additives.""

  A peg is a unit of volume for measuring liquor in India and Nepal. The terms ""large peg"" and ""small peg"" are used, equal to 60 mL and 30 mL, respectively, with ""peg"" simply referring to a small peg. In India liquor's alcohol content is fixed at 42.8% ABV, it follows that a peg of liquor contains 25.68 mL of pure alcohol, or 20.26 g.


And then there is this also: Patiala peg (Wikipedia).


  The Patiala peg is a measure of liquor popular in Indian Punjab. It is a volume roughly equivalent to 120 ml, though the rough and ready measure is the amount of liquor needed to fill a glass equal to the height between the index and little fingers when they are held parallel to one another.[1] Even major liquor companies have started selling their products in the single drink packaging of 90 ml &amp; 120 ml bottles in India. The name originates from the city of Patiala, which was once a state known for the extravagant ways of its royalty and extraordinary height of its Sikh soldiers.

This is likely due to 30ml being easy to both measure out and to drink. 30 ml is pretty standard world-wide as a small or single measure, and multiplying a small measure (rather than have, say, 30ml followed by 50ml) makes things easy. 20ish g of pure alcohol (large peg) or 10g (small peg) is right in line with many countries' &quot;standard drink&quot;s (e.g. the UK &quot;unit&quot; is 8g, but a typical drink has between 1 and 3 units).
Conceivably, the &quot;peg&quot; might be a semi-standardization of an old northern Indian unit of mass called the chhatank, which appears to correspond roughly to 60g, but I think that's more likely a coincidence. 4 of them made up a pao/pau/pav - but that's almost certainly a red herring and unconnected.
Where and when did this sense of the word peg come from?
Likely after and as a consequence of the British Raj. The OED's sense 12 of peg is

colloq. (orig. Anglo-Indian). Originally: a drink of brandy and soda water. Later more generally: a (usually alcoholic) drink, esp. of spirits; a measure of spirits.

The first usage they have is from John Camden Hotten's Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words. All the 19th Century quotations they have seem to refer the mixture of a spirit and something sparkling, mostly soda water. The only clearly Indian quotation they have is from 2003 and refers to the 30ml measure, but they're entirely lacking in quotations between 1939 and 2003.
It seems possible that in turn this usage came from OED's sense 2b, which has quotations going back to 1617:

Any of a set of pins fixed at intervals in a drinking vessel to indicate the quantity each drinker is to drink. Now hist.

But that connection is not made explicitly.

Some alcohols with a high ABV, such as Hungarian Palinka, are sometimes drunk purely for inebriation. They have a high alcohol content mainly to cause the intended effects, not to produce a pleasing drink. These types of spirits are also often flavourless and used to make cocktails with alcohol content.

On the other hand, I've had Scotches that were as high as 60% but very easily drunk neat, and quite pleasing.

So in sum: whether and how someone enjoys a high ABV spirit really depends on the spirit and it's individual qualities.

  Nonetheless, two large studies have found that although moderate drinking will not cure colds, it can help keep them at bay. One, by researchers at Carnegie Mellon in 1993, looked at 391 adults and found that resistance to colds increased with moderate drinking, except in smokers.
  The Claim: A Little Alcohol Can Help You Beat a Cold
  
  Drink alcohol in moderation as a preventative measure. Studies have shown that, while a cold cannot be cured by alcohol, moderate alcohol consumption can increase one's resistance to the cold. One study has shown that drinking 8 to 14 glasses of red wine a week has reduced the chances of getting a cold by 60 percent.
  Knowing How Alcohol Can Help


There will be a very fine line that's easily crossed when using this as a preventative measure... Alcohol dehydrates the body which can weaken your immune system - your body needs lots of fluids to keep up it's normal function. Binge drinking has been clinically shown to lower the body's immune response.

Your body needs all of the fluids, nutrients, and rest it can get to battle symptoms once it's full-blown infected. So, drinking WHILE sick is generally a very bad idea.

With that being said, a shot of whiskey with lemon and honey might help relieve that sore throat and bring on that long night's rest that your body will be craving... Or, a warm beer (in theory.) Just the one, though!

  A price increase may increase that high status and perception of exclusivity, thereby making the good even more preferable. At the other end of the spectrum, with luxury items priced equal to non-luxury items of lower quality, all else being equal more people would buy the luxury items, even though a few Veblen-seekers would not. Thus, even a Veblen good is subject to the dictum that demand moves conversely to price, although the response of demand to price is not consistent at all points on the demand curve.

6653,2,,2017-03-09T13:24:08.933,9,,"Oh... something I am a real expert at! You are mixing your context when calling vines hybrids. There are three ways you can grow grapes for fruit. 100% original ""own rooted"" vines, grafted vines and hybridized vines. 

Let's back up so I can explain why that is. Many Americans in the 1600-1800s tried unsuccessfully to bring European vines to North America and they always died within a few years and they could never figure out. When American vines were brought to France in the 1860s to study the differences between American and European vines, they inadvertently brought a root louse called phylloxera with them in the soil (they also brought over powdery mildew, but that's another story). 

As it came to be, phylloxera completely wiped out most vineyards in Europe within a decade or so. Then started a race to figure out a ""cure"" for this bug. Three methods were attempted. The first was to drown the soil in chemicals to kill the bugs and that worked for a long time. Some vineyards were still operating like that until the 1960s. 

After more research, they figured out that American vines were resistant to phylloxera. So that led to the other two ways of keeping their vines alive. Hybridization between French and American vines. These hybrids were resistant and yet made drinkable wine. Not the same quality as 100% vitis vinifera but hey it got you tipsy just like a good Cabernet did. Many of these hybrids are still around. I have grown several of them. One that I liked a lot is called Leon Millot. The French after WWII, in a fit of purity, have banned most of these grapes and had them ripped out.

The third way was considered the best way to preserve the flavors of the cabernets and chardonnays of the world. They took a page from the apple growing industry, which had already perfected the art of grafting roots onto a different tree. So, they grafted American vines onto French (and German and Italian and so on) vines. This worked out almost perfectly for everyone. In fact, because they use several different vitis species (there is only one vitis species in Europe, vitis vinifera) they were able to more tightly control how the vines grow. This saved the wine industry around the world.

There are only several small pockets and one large one, where phylloxera hasn't invaded. The big one is Washington State in the Northwest corner of the United States. This is where I live. Because of the unique soils (very sandy) and climate (basically a desert) they can grow ""own rooted"" vines. So, if you are in a place where you can buy a Washington State wine, you are tasting the last place on earth where European vines are grown on their own roots.

Can you taste a difference? I would say not really. There are so many factors that come into play when making a wine. Any subtle influences the own rooted vs. rootstock play in flavor is masked by things like oak, climate, yeast and so on. Just be happy there is a place in the world that phylloxera has not invaded!

Assuming there is little return threshold on wine above $20 is, in my humble opinion, a mistake. Because you don't drink a price, but a work. And good work is never cheap.
I'm not talking about marketing, a wine harvested by a dwarf  wrapped in ham on a full moon night before sorting the grape on the tights of virgins ... but about solid facts.

You might consider this :


Producer choices Above everything, a wine producer is a skilled craftman whom makes soil, cultivation,  harvesting, ageing choices, to make the wine that fits his objectives. Whereas some may aim for low quality high quantity, a great number intend to make the best price over quality wine. And those choices can be expensive.
Weather It's plain stupid, but a wine is also a product of rains, snow, temperatures, insects, sickness ... production is random. Of course, you can add water, persticides, fertilizers, use UV light by night and cloudy days. But it'll not taste the same.
Soil&amp;terroir Good soil is rare, and what is rare is expensive. Right terroir also is. Vine don't grow everywhere, and some places are better than other. And as those lands are rare ... Keep in mind that a century old vineyard and a ten years old one doesn't make the same grapes. 
Breeding An industrial wine in steel cask doesn't age and develops flavor the same than in a concrete tank or wood barrel. A wine in a cellar doesn't age like one in estufagem. A wine draught too young will never be good. Don't forget that Pinot Noir, only vines allowed in Burgundy has to age two years in oak barrel and three years in bottle before being opened ? Or that a third of a Savagnin wine barrel evaporate in oxydation to get the taste right ? Well, the producer also has return treshold concerns ...
Harvesting If the harvest is machine made, it's cheap, but immature or rotten grapes go to the pressoir. If it's hand made, it's expensive, but the grapes (and sometimes, every single seed) are harvested the right day : not before, not after. And even after harvest, not everything proceeds to the pressoir.
Legal or crafting obligations In several places in Europe, traditions, rules, even laws determines quality standard. When only the upper two third of an harvest can be made into wine, and the worst third can only be transformed into other products, it has a cost. In France, you cannot put wood dust in your wine to flavour it woody. If you want the wood tastes, you get wood barrel. End of discussion. Adding sugar is restricted. You don't add brandy to cut fermentation. You don't add other fruits. In fact ... it must be 99.9% wine and 0.1% preservatives. If it needs something else than grapes, it's no wine. It's not a moral statement : it just simply isn't wine anymore.
Glass. Is your glass suited for the wine, and its degustation ? It's a common mistake, but there are three kind of glasses : 1/ degustation, standardized to test several wine in same objective conditions 2/ figured : you don't drink Pils, Stout, IPA and Weizenbock in the same beerglass do you ; It does also apply to wine, old&amp;young, white&amp;red does not required the same shape 3/ fancy bullshit. Sorry you bought them. And it's  common in restaurant to have the wrong kind of glass.
Pairing Not every wine fits every dish. Not every wine fits every time of day. Not every wine meets your mood at a precise time.
Your tastes I'm rude, but do you know what you like ? I'm fond of oxydated wines. Most drinkers can't bear them. I don't enjoy champagne. Most drinkers swear by it. You might not have met what you like, and thus you might not know enough in oenology to assess nor appreciate the subtleties. It's easy to learn (if you have a good teacher), but it takes time. I do not buy expensive wines. Because i'm broke. And because i cannot enjoy them fully : i learn and wait until i'm able to enjoy them When i got my drivers licence, i drived a car older than i was. Today i can ride a common sports car. But i would not dare to drive a Porsche or a Ferrari : i would do nothing but find the nearest wall

In fact, some cellarmen changes corks every decades to make sure nothing dreadful happens.

You should at least taste it. If it has spoiled, you'll definitly know it in a few second ... and even before you take a sip, if you are careful to the scent.


If it has gone bad ... well, make vinegar from it if you can't get help from the seller.

If it tastes perfect ... why should you worry ? Any kind of rubbish that could have been dangerous was put inside the wine before it has been draught from the cask. The corks only let a little osmosis with oxygen over the years.

6667,2,,2017-03-15T12:21:24.367,5,,"Personally, I have never had haggis, but pairing it with wine is not all that uncommon. Some even pair it with beer as can be seen here, but I would go with a sweet fruity red wine. Pairing wine with haggis is very common on the web.

Here is a sample of how people wine with haggis:


  A dram of whisky works better after the meal, as its sheer strength means it doesn’t go with the food, so which wine to open first? Red, of course, and something with enough richness to take on haggis, which is sheep’s (occasionally pig’s) “pluck” – the heart, liver and lights (lungs) – mixed with oatmeal, spices and seasoning. 
  
  If you’re still with me (Susy Atkins) and up for it, a bold European red with a little savouriness and black pepper is by far the best. 
  
  Spanish tempranillo, aged in oak casks, and tasting of ripe red berries, wood spice and vanilla, is my favourite match. - Why I'll be drinking red wine - not whisky - with my haggis


Here is another:


  Haggis is quite a funky-tasting meat - a bit like a savoury, spicy sausage - so I think red wine is a better match than white. I’ve found big jammy reds such as Australian shiraz work well (there is appropriately enough one called Bobbie Burns shiraz (available for about £15-£16 from independents including Alexander Hadleigh and Old Butcher's Wine Cellar. 
  
  Northern Rhône syrah and grenache/syrah/mourvèdre (GSM) blends from the southern Rhône, the Languedoc and Australia are also good matches, especially if they have a year or two’s bottle age. - The best wines to pair with haggis


And finally:


  Wine pairing with haggis – grape growing and winemaking techniques
  
  Grapes grown in hotter climates often have riper fruit which add to flavour intensity and texture of the wine; but also the sugar levels in the grapes are generally much higher adding further mouthfeel, so a sign is to look for wines that have perhaps 13.5% or above alcohol by volume. 
  
  Oak fermentation and/or oak ageing adds flavour and texture too, so clues are sometimes on the label; be aware ‘oaked’ is not generally a style that adds texture, look for the word ‘aged’ to ensure it has seen the inside of an oak cask. This week on our WSET Level 2 Wine Course we had an outstanding Puligny-Montrachet and also a equally impressive Chateauneuf-du-Pape, both would have successfully met the haggis-pairing challenge.

In the De Re Rustica chapter about Roman wine, he talks about the very highest quality wine called Falernian he says: 


  It is surprising to learn that all of them were white wines - until you also learn that they were all sweet. The tast of the Augustan age (27bc - 14 ad) was for wine that was sweet and strong, and very often cooked in much the same way as madeira is today. Usually it was drunk diluted with warm water or even seawater. 


Wine did not last that long back then. They kept it in Amphora and it probably had to be drunk within the year after picking before it turned to vinegar.

There is a lot more in the chapter about how cheaper wines they added flavorings like herbs, spices and resins. 

So, my answer is to seek out a Retsina from Greece. Retsina, is a sweet, strong white wine made with pine resin. This is probably the closest you are going to get to a wine that was made 2000 years ago.

Reinforcing pairing, aim to emphasis the tastes of either food or beverage, or both. A Jura oxydized wine over a smoked poultry.

Correcting pairing aim to neutralize an unwelcomed taste from either,
Edam cheese and Lambic/Ould Bruin, to cut the acidic dryness of the beer for those whom don't enjoy it.

Zero pairing, aim to wash out the taste of one by the second, just to always have the first bit/sip flavours. Ginger with japanese gastronomy

Contrast pairing, aim to a deliberate yet welcomed discrepency between food and beverage. Earthy beer over shellfish.

=> Do keep in mind that the pairing can not only be on the taste, but also on texture. A ""greasy"" food with a ""drying"" drink for example.

In your case, more than the spider itself, you plan a chili sauce. So, the drink will deal with spicyness : it implies a lost of tasting capacity by overcrowing of one or various of the fundamental tastes (Saltiness/Sweetness/Bitterness/Sourness+Umami+Astingency+Pungency). In this case, saltiness and pungency will be the dominant you'll have to pair with.


If you want to reinforce it, you shall look to strong liquors, which will get the pungency stonger (ethanol have it's own burning sensation) ; but you may have to water not to burn your tastebuds. A salty vodka ?
If you want to correct it, you shall seek fat drinks, as spicyness agent are mostly lipophyllic. Thats why many a western guest enjoy Lassi with Indian curry.
If you want to zero it, but only with a light chili, you may try a red wine from old vineyards, the kind of wine where spices notes are powerful. Wine itself will be lost, but it'll reset your tastebuds as alcohol is a solvant and the wine is quite tannic, the astringent side will make you salivate. Syrah wine on fifty, eighty years old vines.
If you want a contrast, try a malted and hopped beer, where rye is involved. It's rich mouthfull will compete with the crispy feeling of the bug, and rye, even more than oat, bear spice quite well.


Obviously, if you abandon the chili, those recommandation are void ; but you now have the keys to make the match yourself.

Producer Choices
Weather

Breeding

Legal Obligations


The gist of the answer being that the production that has gone into the wine has a significant impact on the final product, with some production methods resulting in a high quality wine, and others resulting in a lower quality wine.

So my essential problem here is that if I go into a wine shop and am choosing from vintage wines where, grape variety, and sugar content are similar, how can I choose between two bottles in a non-arbitrary, and objective way?


Should I be researching specific aspects of their production methods?
Should I focus on who produced the wine?
Should I focus on region?
Should I rely on ratings of the wine?

You can't. It's purely a subjective exercise. It is a dark art that takes a lot of tasting and learning what regions you like and winemakers you like. Even high points from a well known critic aren't a sure bet. If I were you, I would start reading Wine Spectator and Wine Advocate and whatever online wine resources you can find to get an education about what you like. 

Things are easier in Europe where they more tightly control the wine making/grape growing process and some regions like Bordeaux, Champagne and Burgundy you can assume a certain high quality from a certain appellation. In the ""New"" world (USA, Australia, South Africa, etc) it's more of a crap shoot. Napa Valley wine is not a sure bet. It involves a lot of research and personal preference. 

People spend many years and tons of money trying to figure this out and it's a never ending process. The journey is long and paved with many bad bottles. Good luck!

First is alcohol, which is a byproduct of the fermentation of starch by yeast. Starch is a carbohydrate, and it has it's own nutriting quality, including energy. Its energy is transferred to alcohol.

If the energy it carries is not used by basal metabolism or physical activity, it'll be stored. It is why non pathological drinker get fat. But drinking regularly may drive you to pathological drinking, even when you never get drunk nor make any excess.

Second is cereal malt (beer component) and non fermented starch itself : first is an aliment (cattle) and second is a carbohydrate : they are particularly fit for storing when unused.

Third is oestrogen. Hop, the flavouring and conservative plant used in beer production carries a phyto-oestrogen, which has the same effect on the human body as the feminine hormone. One of the effect of oestrogen is modifying the fat storage (many a women complain on her weight change under contraceptive pills), both for developing sexual character (women's are the sole primate with permanent breasts) and storing fat in case of starvation during pregnancy.
You already guessed why messing with hormonal rates in your body is no option.

I strongly recommend you to seek help in gaining weight from a trained medical staff, or at least from a specialized Stack Exchange site. A change in your feeding habits may be way more efficient and less hazardous.

Basically, you must eat and brink more than your body burns, while making the right amount of physical exercise to gain muscles as well as body fat. Beer nutriment don't really matches the kind of food you shall seek with this objective.

Firstly, I shall examine the passage in the original Greek:

ἔσται γὰρ μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ οἶνον καὶ σίκερα οὐ μὴ πίῃ, καὶ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου πλησθήσεται ἔτι ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ.

The two words we are intereted in here are 'οἶνον' ('wine'), and 'σίκερα' ('strong drink'). The second ('σίκερα') is interesting in that it is a loan word directly from the Hebrew word 'שכר' (transliterated 'shekar'). The two (in both languages) are usually used in conjunction with each other, to form the phrase 'wine and strong drink' to encompass the whole variety of intoxicants. [1]
The Wine
Wine was the ubiquitous alcoholic beverage of the ancient world. The process by which the ancient peoples made wine was simple. First, they pressed grapes into grape juice, then they left the juice in large earthenware jars to ferment. Fermentation took two weeks to a month. Distillation had not yet been discovered, so Roman wine was of about the same strength as modern wine (around 13%), or possibly a bit stronger.
While Romans traditionally diluted their wine with water (roughly one part wine to two parts water), making it a beverage that could be drunk all day long, without danger of drunkenness, people living in provinces, such as Judea, are not supposed to have done so. That said, it is likely that the Roman officials did dilute their wine, in keeping with the custom back in Rome. Because of this, it is also likely that citizens wishing to curry their favour might also have adopted this custom. The Greeks also diluted their wine (roughly one part wine to four parts water). [2]
Other Alcohols
Other alcohols included beer, which became significantly less popular than wine. In particular, wealthy Romans looked down on the drinking of beer. Tacitus (writing much later, in the 1st Century AD) wrote disparagingly of German beer. Barley wine (a type of strong ale, roughly 6-11%) existed, as well as alcohols made from whatever fruits might be growing in the vicinity. For example, when Caesar arrived in Britain in 55BC, he found the locals drinking an apple cider, a custom he and his men adopted with enthusiasm. [3]
I have not be able to find any evidence for the consumption of distilled spirits or liqueurs.
Abstention
Abstaining from alcohol was not as easy then as it might be now. Since a large proportion of running water was (and still is) undrinkable, ancient peoples turned to alcohol (in particular wine) as a daily staple, giving them the fluid they needed. The water mixed with wine would be (somewhat) sterilised, allowing it to be drunk, and making the wine go further. One assumes that John must have drunk water only, or at least non-alcoholic juices (grape, etc.). There is reference in the bible to non-alcoholic wines, although this is rare.

What is banana beer?


  Banana beer is an alcoholic beverage made from fermentation of mashed bananas. Sorghum, millet or maize flour are added as a source of wild yeast.


And there is a difference with banana wine.


  Banana wine is a fruit wine made exclusively from bananas. It is different from banana beer, which has a long tradition and great cultural significance in East Africa. Blocker et al. (2001)1 wrote a chapter on ""Banana Wine"" in the book ""Alcohol and temperance in modern history: an international encyclopedia"", though this is slightly confusing, as they define what is traditionally referred to as banana beer as being banana wine. The data they present on Production Techniques and Social Practices and Rituals relates to the latter and not to what is commonly known as banana wine.


Here is how to make banana beer the African way.


  Bananas
  
  Peel ripe bananas by hand. Only use bananas ripe enough to be peeled by hand 
  
  Extract Juice 
  
  Use grass to knead the bananas until clear juice is extracted. The residue will remain in the grass. 
  
  Mix water 
  
  Mix 1:3 water: banana juice ratio. 
  
  Mix sorghum 
  
  Sorghum flour:banana juice ratio, 1:12. Stir the mixture well. Sorghum is added to improve the color and the flavor of the beer 
  
  Ferment 
  
  Ferment in plastic containers covered by polyethylene bags. Allow to ferment 18 -24 hours.
  
  Filter 
  
  Force the liquid through a cotton cloth bag either by hand or use a press. 
  
  Bottle 
  
  Place in 1 liter size plastic bottles 
  
  Shelf Life 
  
  Several days, refrigerated - African Banana Beer


Here is how to make homemade banana wine.


  How to Make Homemade Banana Wine
  
  Ingredients:
  
  21 lbs of RIPE bananas, sliced into thin rings
  
  5 gallons water (You won’t use it all)
  
  15-20 lbs white and/or brown sugar (We used white)
  
  6 tsp acid blend
  
  5 tsp pectinase
  
  1.25 tsp wine tannin
  
  6 tsp yeast nutrient
  
  4 lbs golden raisins
  
  1 packets of wine yeast (We like Red Star “Champagne” for this recipe)
  
  Potassium sorbate or other wine stabilizer
  
  Equipment:
  
  7.5 gallon pot (or bigger)
  
  1 6.5 gallon fermenter bucket and lid
  
  1 or 2 6.5 gallon glass carboys &amp; stoppers
  
  1 air lock
  
  Siphon, siphon tubing.
  
  Place raisins in a freshly sanitized 6.5 gallon fermenting bucket. Carefully strain hot banana liquid into the fermenting bucket, over top of the raisins. Top with water to 6 gallons, and add a few scoops of the banana mush. Cover with sanitized lid and air lock, allow to cool to room temperature (overnight).
  
  The next morning, give the mixture a quick stir with a sanitized paddle, and – using sanitized equipment – take a gravity reading. Keep track of the number! (This is an optional step, but will allow you to calculate your final ABV %)
  
  Sprinkle yeast into fermenter, cover with sanitized cover and air lock. Within 48 hours, you should notice fermentation activity – bubbles in the airlock, carbonation and /or swirling in the wine must. This means you’re good to go! 
  
  Let sit for about a week, stirring (sanitized paddle!) Every couple of days or so. It will get black on top. It’ll look awful… and your whole brewing area / basement / garage will smell like banana bread!
  
  After a week or so, use your sanitized siphon setup to rack the must into a freshly sanitized 6.5 gallon carboy. (At this point, we ran the raisins and remaining pulp through a juicer and added it to the carboy, but that’s entirely optional. Will give the wine extra body if you do it!)
  
  Put the carboy somewhere cool (not cold!), and leave it alone for a month or so.
  
  Using sanitized equipment, rack the banana wine off the sediment, into a clean, freshly sanitized 6.5 gallon carboy. (At this point, we added 4 lbs sugar for added sweetness. It probably also upped the final ABV!). Cap with sanitized airlock, leave it alone for another 2-3 months.

For a weaker mead, mix a sextarius of water with nine ounces of honey. The whole is exposed to the sun for 40 days, and then left on a shelf near the fire. If you have no rain water, then boil spring water.

The sky is the limit on designing a label. I had to spend about $1000 USD to have a decent label designed. Then printing it on really high quality paper cost $$$$. I was charging between $30-$50 a bottle for my wine.

I was spending around $0.25 a label, $.40 a cork, $.50 tin capsule and about $0.75 a glass bottle. I can only imagine that production costs on the Canary islands are probably double that because it costs so much to ship that stuff to the islands. 

Packaging costs become less of a factor the more expensive your wine is. For me it was about $3 per bottle. If you wine costs $10 then it's a huge percentage. If you are charging $50, then it becomes less of an issue.

Wine labels are like snowflakes, not two are alike and why someone would choose eye popping graphics for a low production wine from the Canary Islands, I have no idea. Those usually are reserved for supermarket level wines so you are compelled to pick it up off the shelf.

Mead is pretty simple to make. Water, honey and some yeast. Most people get filtered water. Then boil it with the honey to sterilize the honey (especially important if you use unfiltered). Then let it cool off and add yeast. I would also add yeast nutrients since honey lacks the nutrients to really work good. Also, use wine yeast since it's adapted to higher alcohol levels than beer yeast.

Once it's cooled off you pour it in a fermentation vessel. You will need some space between the level of the fermenting mead and the airlock for foaming. After fermentation has stopped, then you need to have it almost to the top of the bottle so there is no oxidation occurring.

I am not sure about the sun exposure, in fact I would keep it out of the sun unless you need to warm it up, which is what they may have been trying to do in ancient times.

  A lot of people don't realize this, but there's nothing particular
  that makes altar wine ""altar wine"". The wine for the Precious Blood
  must be true wine, made from grapes, and have no additional sweeteners
  or flavorings, or preservatives (beyond a bare minimum), or anything
  else. The vast majority of wines available on the shelf might
  potentially be used as altar wine. The only difference is that a
  competent authority in the Church has certified this wine for use at
  the altar.
  
  That's a long way of sayiing that vintners produce a line of wine and
  most of the bottles get ""regular"" labels, and some of them get ""altar
  wine"" labels, but the product inside is identical. It might already be
  on the shelf at your local store, but it's just not labeled the same.
  
  So you could contact the winery, ask who their distributors are, and
  buy all you want. A very few wineries cater exclusively to Catholic
  churches, so you might have some difficulty getting them to sell it to
  you--not because they can't but simply because they don't have any
  method of selling to a private person.

  The winery’s story began in 1851 when a group of Jesuit priests bought 100 acres in the heart of the Clare Valley and named it Sevenhill, hoping to create a Catholic cultural centre akin to the Sevenhill district of Rome. 
  
  The Jesuits started a winery that began supplying sacramental wine to the surrounding parishes in 1858.

  Sevenhill's sacramental wine is made in three styles in a similar fortified method to Apera (the official name for sherry in Australia). Sweet Red is a blend of Grenache, Ruby Cabernet and Pedro Ximenez grapes. Sevenhill's sacramental wine is made as naturally as possibly with minimal winemaking intervention in conformity with the requirements of Canon Law. - Wine Portfolio: Sacramental / Altar Wines

Canada will be celebrating the 150th anniversary of its foundation as a country on July 1, 1867 and we are planning to make the meal more European in nature in order to remind ourselves of our roots. 

We will have be basing our meal on some Michaelmas traditions from England by having roast goose, chestnut stuffing, rice, gravy,  Brussels sprouts and blackberry pie for dessert (in remembrance of the Blackberry legend involving Lucifer and St Michael). 

My question is quite simple: What alcoholic drinks pair well with roast goose? I am thinking wine, but am open to other recommendations.

6730,2,,2017-04-02T14:18:22.310,3,,"Let's start with what are Nomex corks and what are natural corks.


  Nomex is a registered trademark for flame-resistant meta-aramid material developed in the early 1960s by DuPont and first marketed in 1967.
  
  Nomex and related aramid polymers are related to nylon, but have aromatic backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable. Nomex is the premier example of a meta variant of the aramids (Kevlar is a para aramid). Unlike Kevlar, Nomex cannot align during filament formation and has poorer strength. However, it has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance for a polymer material.


""Nomex corks"" for wine do not exist. In fact ""Nomex cork"" material is used as a gasket material for engines and the like. I believe you are thinking of rubber corks. 

Natural cork comes from the outer bark of the cork tree.


  Cork is produced from the sponge like material taken from cork oak trees, also known as Quercus Suber. Cork oak trees are grown primarily in Portugal. Cork started to become the sealing material of choice in the late 1600’s when it became possible to create glass wine bottles with an almost uniform shape and design. It took until the late 1700’s to create easy to use corkscrews for the wine lover or tavern owner. At that point in history, cork replaced glass wine stoppers, which while they worked well, glass stoppers were not easy to remove without breaking the wine bottle. The pairing of the cork and wine bottle ushered fine wine into the modern age, as from that point forward, wine had the ability to age and evolve in the bottle. Interestingly cork and fine wine share another commonality. The cork, oak tree needs to be at least 25 years old before the material used to create the cork can be harvested. This is similar to the age of vines in many of the world’s best wine regions. While grape vines are harvested every year, cork trees are only able to be harvested once every nine years. - Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks 


Alternative wine closures or corks can be seen here and many are known as rubber corks and plastic corks: 


  Alternative wine closures are substitute closures used in the wine industry for sealing wine bottles in place of traditional cork closures. The emergence of these alternatives has grown in response to quality control efforts by winemakers to protect against ""cork taint"" caused by the presence of the chemical trichloroanisole (TCA). - Alternative wine closures (Wikipedia)


There are pros and cons to using of all types of corks.


  The problems with synthetic corks is the lack of a perfect seal. In turn that allows more unwanted air into the bottle, causing the wine to oxidize. Worse, many of the synthetic corks have been known to impart a slight rubber or chemical smell, damaging the wine. Beherns and Hitchcock, a producer of Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa California was one of the early proponents of plastic corks. Most of the wines bottled using those synthetic corks have not developed well. Many of those wines are defective. However, today, they have improved since their initial creation. Because the plastic corks allow air to integrate at a faster pace than normal corks, some winemakers actually prefer it. In fact, that has become part of the selling point as the corks can be ordered to allow for a more or less rapid transmission of air into the wine, based on the tightness of seal.
  
  Wine corks do however have problems, the major issue being infection with TCA, which causes what is known by wine collectors and others in the wine business as Corked Wine. Corked bottles of wine remains a serious problem in the wine industry as many people think that it effects between 5% to 10% of all wine undrinkable.
  
  The old saying that nothing lasts forever is especially true with wine. When a wine cork degrades, so does the wine, due to additional exposure to air, which in turn causes premature oxidization. Before that happens, for rare and expensive bottles, it might be possible to replace your old cork with a new wine cork. This is something you cannot do at home on your own. For more on replacing your wine cork, Everything you need to know about Re-Corking wine bottles.
  
  Corks have been the undisputed choice to seal wine bottles for hundreds of years. But with all the alternative enclosures available these days, by 2016, it is estimated that only 70% of all wine bottles today are sealed with natural corks. Still, at the end of day, it is unlikely corks will be replaced as the sealer of choice for the best wines. In part, there is the romance and tradition of removing the cork, coupled with that special popping sound that lets you know, you are about to drink a wine and that is something technology cannot improve on. - Wine Corks Everything You Need to Know About Wine Corks

  Goose is, of course, stronger-flavoured than turkey - more like game but - crucially - quite a bit fattier which makes it essential in my book to look for a wine that has a fair level of acidity. It also tends to be accompanied by powerfully flavoured accompaniments such as chestnuts and red cabbage. Other traditional (and very good) accompaniments are potato or potato and apple stuffing, apples and prunes which can also affect your pairing:
  
  Top quality German or Alsace Grand Cru Riesling
  
  Probably the best match of all if you’re planning an apple or apple and prune stuffing. A dry spätlese Riesling would be ideal, cutting through the fat and providing a subtle touch of sweetness. The drawback is that your guests may well expect a red - but there’s no reason why you can’t serve both.
  
  Gewürztraminer
  
  A bolder choice still for Christmas. Obviously it’s not to everyone’s taste but if you serve a slightly spicy stuffing, especially one that contains dried fruits and/or ginger it would make a great match. Again look for a top quality wine with some intensity from Alsace or New Zealand which is making some great examples.
  
  Pinot Noir
  
  Probably the most likely wine to please your guests and certainly the one to choose if you’re going for red cabbage, sweet potatoes or other richly flavoured veg. I’d choose an example with some sweet, silky fruit rather than big tannins otherwise you may suffer from palate overload .
  
  And some beers to go with goose
  
  Strong Belgian Trappist beers such as Chimay or beers made in that style
  
  These are just as good a match for goose as wine is if truth be told but there are, admittedly, likely to be fewer takers. No harm in having one or two available though. - What to drink with goose


Here is what another site has to say about pairing drinks with goose:


  The richness of goose demands a good wine, such as a top red Burgundy. However, it is often served with sweet side dishes, in which case a sweetish German Riesling might be a good option. In the mid-range, you could try a California Pinot Noir, a good red Rhône or an Australian Shiraz. - Pairing Wine with Meat, Game and Poultry 


If it is beer your into than here you go:  


  Dubbel is also great with duck or goose. The rich and earthy flavor of these birds requires a beer with some heft to it and the dense, dried fruit flavor of dubbel recalls the dark berry sauces that are so commonly served with these birds.
  
  Doppelbock offers another riff on this idea, offering strength and dark berry flavors amidst those of caramel, plums, and figs.
  
  Beers to try: For Dubbel, look to the Chimay above, or grab a Rochefort 6 or Ommegang Abbey Ale. For Doppelbock, Ayinger's Celebrator and Weihenstephan's Korbinian are awesome, widely-available choices. - The Serious Eats Guide to Holiday Beer Pairing

Talk about drinking to your health, some say this is an excellent medicinal liqueur. Here in Canada, the Chartreuse liqueur is very expensive.


  The two types of Chartreuse are:
  
  Green Chartreuse (110 proof or 55%) is a naturally green liqueur made from 130 herbs and plants macerated in alcohol and steeped for about 8 hours. A last maceration of plants gives its colour to the liqueur.
  
  Yellow Chartreuse (80 proof or 40%), which has a milder and sweeter flavour and aroma.

These are then taken to the distillery and macerated with a neutral alcohol spirit which is then distilled. - What is Chartreuse Liqueur?

That said, I'll summarise my most critical ones, and the thoughts that guided me when distilling my own whisky:


Aging: the cask imparts the vast majority of the flavour, from the type of wood, the previous contents, how charred the cask is, length of time in the cask etc. The more desirable whiskies carefully choose casks and aging to deliver tastes that customers will like. This typically costs money (especially for storage costs) so a cheap whisky may not put so much effort into cask selection, quality control, age etc.
The Middle Cut: The foreshots start off with mostly methanol so would not taste good, and are mostly poisonous, but a small amount of methanol is useful in the process (and evaporates first after casting as part of the Angel's Share anyway) so the decision when to extract the middle cut is essential. Similarly, the feints, which contain propanol and heavier fusel oils are not wanted so are fed back into the spirit still. But there will be a small amount in the final product. Knowing how much of the foreshots and feints to include is part of the master distiller's craft.
Speed of heating / shape of still: Tall stills give a very smooth clear taste, especially when slowly heated. Short, squat stills combined with rapid heating allow many more fusel oils and other substances into the distillate, which will make the flavour more interesting, but can lead to a lack of smoothness.


Some cheaper spirits get around some of these issues by multiple distillations to remove some of the more complex substances - this can lead to an easier flavour for drinking, but also to something far more boring (from the perspective of a whisky afficionado) and bland.

6747,2,,2017-04-07T15:40:25.690,0,,"
  So why is bourbon so sweet?
  
  It’s all about the corn mash. The stuff those geniuses ferment.
  
  Bourbon’s mashbill is made of at least 51% corn, often far more
  (closer to 70% as an average). Four Roses has two mashbills, one with
  60% corn and one with 75% corn. There are various high-rye, low-rye,
  wheat and whatever else mashbills but all share one characteristic –
  at least 51% corn.
  
  Scotch, on the other hand, uses mostly or all barley in its mash and
  the glucose content of corn is much higher. That glucose is what gives
  bourbon its easily recognizable sweetness.
  
  51%+ corn in the mash is why bourbon is so sweet.

6748,2,,2017-04-07T23:00:26.103,4,,"Many chemical compounds, like saccharin for example, can taste sweet. There are hundreds of chemical compounds in bourbon and a number of them or combinations of them can lead to that sense of sweetness. Ethanol itself has a sweet flavor. The sugar from the corn itself however, will not make it through the distillation process. If we consider for a moment corn based vodka, you'll notice that it doesn't have the same sweet flavor.

I'd say that what sets bourbon apart is the number of chemical compounds present, collectively adding to the sweetness. An important contributor to these compounds are the flavors that come from the barrel, most noticeably vanillin. Vanillin tastes like, well..... vanilla. Another is 3-Methyl-4-octanolide, also known as whisky lactone, which adds more vanilla flavor as well as coconut. The other major contributor are esters. Esters are one of the congeners, things other than ethanol that make it through distillation. Esters add more fruit flavors. One such ester is ethyl hexanoate, which can provide like a pineapple or slightly green banana flavor.

You can actually get totally different compounds in the bottle while using the exact same production materials too. For example in the barrel, a lower alcohol content won't penetrate the wood as deeply as a higher alcohol content would. The sweeter flavors are pretty shallow in the wood so if I wanted to make something sweet, I'd dilute the alcohol a little before aging. You won't be able to tell this by looking at the alcohol content on the bottle though, because the higher proof stuff going into the barrel will be diluted after aging. It's all part of the process.

  So-called ""flask canes"" or ""tippling sticks"" are still a thing, even in the booze-soaked wonderland of 21st century America. One site even targets veterans by putting seals from the various branches of the US military on top of the cane. War is hell, after all, so who are we to judge? 




The Booze Mule Trick


  From the Walter P. Reuther Library at Wayne State University, this circa-1920s photo depicts a man showing off his trick for transporting booze throughout Detroit. He reportedly only showed this to the press, for obvious reasons, and remained anonymous.
  
  A shocking 75% of all the alcohol smuggled into the US during Prohibition crossed the border at the so-called ""Windsor-Detroit Funnel,"" the nickname for waterways between Michigan and Ontario.

  Jennie MacGregor was arrested by federal agents in Minneapolis on April 10, 1924 for this audacious get-up that dispensed ""wet goods."" It was known, according to a note on the back of the original photograph, as a ""bootlegger's life preserver."" The New York Times purchased the photo 10 days later and published it in their weekly Mid-Week Pictorial under the caption ""A Perfect 36.""
  
  (David Dunlap of the Times' ""The Lively Morgue"" blog guesses this was a reference to ""Tennessee, the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment, granting women’s suffrage?"").

  ""Flask"" might not be quite the right word for these behemoths. The original 1928 caption called them ""tins"" concealed by a ""floppy overcoat."" No word on how exactly these were held in place, but it they were full, they must have given this young flapper quite the workout.

6756,2,,2017-04-09T15:53:41.063,4,,"Is there a real reason for putting salt in beer?


  Putting salt in beer stems from a few philosophies - all of which seem to have had a purpose at one time or another.
  
  · An old wives' tale said that putting a sprinkle of salt in your beer would stave off cramping during hard work. Dehydration can cause cramping of the muscles, because of the depletion of minerals in the body. Adding salt to the beer would make the worker thirsty, and thus he would drink more beer to relieve the dehydration. 
  
  · Others add salt to beer for flavor purposes; post-prohibition (1933) beer had turned into somewhat of an ugly being. Breweries had to cut costs and started to use cheaper ingredients like rice and corn, which made for a nearly flavorless beer. These beers are still around, though most people have become accustomed to flavorless beer and so have no need for the salt. Many South and Central American beer drinkers will add salt and sometimes hot sauce and/or lemon, for flavor, or to mask off flavor in beer. 
  
  Here is what bartenders have heard their patrons say why they use/like beer salt:
  
  
  I like the way it tastes. (Salt is a natural flavor enhancer)
  It makes me thirstier so I can drink more. (Salt increases thirst)
  I don’t have to pee as often. (Salt retains fluid)
  I don’t belch as much. (Salt removes carbonation)
  I can drink more and don’t fill up as fast. (Less carbonation)
  My dad/grandpa always drank it this way. (Family tradition)
  The guy with the pretty blond is doing it. (My favorite)

I understand that the term county may not exist in some counties, so one can adopt a different term that may be better suited for a particular countries.

What is a dry county?


  A dry county is a county in the United States whose government forbids the sale of any kind of alcoholic beverages. Some prohibit off-premises sale, some prohibit on-premises sale, and some prohibit both. Hundreds of dry counties exist across the United States, a majority of them in the South. A number of smaller jurisdictions also exist, such as cities, towns, and townships, which prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages. These are known as dry cities, dry towns, or dry townships.

6761,2,,2017-04-10T14:54:44.343,3,,"First, congratulations on getting bit by the homebrewing bug!  

Yes, you can actually drop bourbon/scotch/whiskey into your fermented beer to add that flavor. Why after fermentation? To make sure you don't kill the yeast before they do their job. The hardest part is getting the right spirit to blend with the beer you're making. Darker beers tend to hold up to spirits better because of the unfermented dark roasted malts and robustness that off-set the alcohol you're placing in them. Dropping bourbon in a sour would probably be a waste of time, effort, and good alcohol.  

Homebrewers more commonly use ""other"" ingredients to impart other flavors to beer that might not be approved for commercial use. Brew Your Own has a section called Mister Wizard that addressed a little of this in one of the responses. This should kind of give you an idea of the ""mad scientist"" aspect of homebrew beer additives.


  The same is true if one chooses to add oak chips to the secondary fermentation. After I got the brew where I wanted it with respect to beer flavor, oak flavor and aged flavors, I would begin to play with adding the wine or spirit component. This type of blending is always best done by preparing several samples of beer with varying levels of blended mixtures so that the flavor impact can be tasted over a range of concentrations. You may find that even a little of the planned flavor additive makes for a vile brew and you can avert a disaster.


However, the easier and more repeatable version (albeit more money than most recreational brewers will care to spend) is to buy a bourbon barrel and let your beer age in them to absorb the bourbon-y goodness. Dragon's Milk and Sexual Chocolate are two solid mentions (in my opinion).

There are several existing colored absinthe on the market at the moment and a couple of ways to get various colored varieties. Artificial coloring is the most common.

Absinthe may be found in the following colors: Green, Red (or Rose), Yellow, Brown, Clear and Blue.

One way to get the desired colored is to make your own absinthe as can be seen in the following recipe. 


  Put the dry herbs in a large jar. Dampen slightly. Add 800 milliliters of 85-95 percent alcohol. Wine spirits make a better product than pure grain alcohol. Let steep for several days - a week is better - shaking occasion absinthe. Then add 600 milliliters of water and let the whole macerate for another day. Decant off the liquid squeezing as much from the mass of herb as possible. Wet the herbs with some vodka and squeeze again. Recipe should give a little over a liter and a half of green liquor. It must then be distilled... - Traditional absinthe recipe 


There or other non-traditional herbs and artificial coloring agents that are used to make a particular color also.


  Absinthe can be classified differently
  
  By color:
  
  Green absinthe – classically natural color of absinthe. Color can vary from deep emerald to light green or olive shade. Practically every manufacturer produces green absinthe. But because the natural dye (chlorophyll from the leaves) is not durable therefore manufacturers in most cases use artificial coloring. To preserve natural green color of absinthe it is bottle in green or brown bottles. 
  
  Yellow absinthe – is usually natural colored because natural dye from chlorophyll has a tendency to lose its color and become more yellowish in couple of months after production (aging of absinthe). 
  
  Red absinthe – is colored by extract of pomegranate or macerated with blossoms of hibiscus what gives absinthe light-ruby shade and original after-taste. But nowadays majority of red absinthes are artificially colored. 
  
  Brown absinthe – unlike all the other absinthes this kind is macerated with the roots of wormwood not the leaves of blossoms. Also dark color can be achieved by adding black cutch extract which brings slight flavour of berries. - Kinds of Absinthe


Wikipedia has this to say about absinthe:


  Absinthe may also be naturally coloured pink or red using rose or hibiscus flowers. This was referred to as a rose (pink) or rouge (red) absinthe. Only one historical brand of rose absinthe has been documented.
  
  Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as to the quality of its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.
  
  Blanche, or la Bleue: Blanche absinthe (also referred to as la Bleue in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and reduction, and is uncoloured (clear). The name la Bleue was originally a term used for bootleg Swiss absinthe, but has become a popular term for post-ban-style Swiss absinthe in general.


As noted in Montijello's excellent answer, clear absinthe may be easily artificially colored.

There are a variety of Clear Absinthes on the market as can be seen on the following website:


  Clear Absinthe
  
  This is usually the favourite of people trying absinthe for the first time, and of the most experience absintheurs: where absinthe drinkers settle again in the end, having explored the world of green absinthe. Quite simply because it is balanced and delicious. Much of the finest absinthe is clear. Also known as Blanche, La Bleue, and white absinthe...

For Mexican food, Tequila (or Mescal) is the obvious choice. You could go the US way and make some margaritas, but to me that sounds boring (and ideally needs a margarita machine, or at least decent amounts of ice, which is not always available, if you are on a boat or something).

Sangrita is said to be a common partner to Tequila. According to Wikipedia,:


  Sangrita (meaning ""little blood""), whose origin dates back to the 1920s, is a customary partner to a shot of straight tequila blanco; a non-alcoholic accompaniment that highlights tequila's crisp acidity and cleanses the palate between each peppery sip. The basic conception of sangrita is to complement the flavor of 100% agave tequila, which is also peppery and citrusy in taste.


Although originally it's a fruity juice, I would recommend the tomato-based variant as food companion.


  While most outsiders would reference its red make up as tomato juice and spices, locals and traditionalists agree that the one ingredient that most likely doesn't belong is tomato.


Another thing to consider is the Tequila variant to use. Originally clear/silver is the way to go, but I prefer a brown/golden Tequila (can be a fake one, does not have a pricey barrel-aged one).

Mix Sangrita (store-bought or homemade, see linked Wikipedia article for recipes) and Tequila to taste and garnish with a big stem of cilantro, and there you go.

6765,2,,2017-04-12T16:37:24.680,2,,"I decided to dig into this because I have been home brewing off and on for 20 years and never really used a pressure barrel. 

Pressure Barrels seem to be more widely used in the UK and Australian markets than in the USA where we use Cornelius kegs instead. 

Pressure barrels are made out of plastic and come in a variety of sizes, the most common seem to be about the 5 gallon/25 liter size. 

To use a pressure barrel you move your freshly fermented beer into this vessel and prime with some type of sugar and let it sit for a couple of weeks while it builds up carbonation. Then you serve from the tap.

They are designed to withstand a lot of pressure, but I am sure there is a theoretical limit that I couldn't find. However, they do come with a pressure relief valve in the lid that limits the pressure to give you carbonation within certain parameters and to protect you from the scenario asked above.

I did find this on a pdf on the web:


  Whichever cap you have they are designed to release excess pressure, sometimes barrels may bulge under the pressure, but the cap should automatically release when needed. If needed pressure can be released manually by slightly opening the lid by unscrewing and allowing CO2 out, if for example the holes on the cap had become blocked. Between brews check the caps are clean and free from any build up which could stop them from releasing pressure, and make sure they are well cleaned in clean warm water to ensure the rubber 'bands' are not stuck in position with any sticky liquid that may have come into contact with them.


Let say, for argument's sake, that the pressure relief valve was stuck and you put waaaay too much priming sugar in. I don't think the pressure barrel would ever explode. There are two weak points that would probably fail before it go to that point and that's the lid and the serving valve which would both probably vent before it got to that pressure.

So, to answer this question, there is almost zero chance it would explode and would probably just have a leak of some type with infinite yeast and sugar.

  Breweries in Norway began making this special blend of ""the best local beers"" in 1934, but it met a lot of opposition from Christian groups. After World War II, however, the tradition picked up popularity and is still a common holiday brew today. Photo: Shutterstock.




And by the way do not forget your Easter Beer Hunt!

6777,2,,2017-04-16T13:47:56.823,6,,"This is very broad so I will stick to wine in my answer. There are many considerations for pouring, you have the aesthetic aspects and presentation, and you have the mechanical aspects which can change the properties of the served drink. 

For wine, the waitress was right from a presentation point of view when served in a fine dining setting. Holding the bottle by the base gives the server the maximum reach with good control, twisting at the end helps reduce drips, the napkin can be used for any cleanup quickly, and showing the label assures the customer they are being served the wine of their choice. This technique does not effect the consumption, if you are entertaining at home there's no right or wrong way really, although I find the hold and twist give me the same advantages when I'm serving wine at my table. 

From a mechanical aspect, with wine the major considerations are sediment with red wines and bubbles with sparkling wine. If you have a red wine with sediment you need to be careful to not shake up the bottle and to leave the dregs in the bottom as you pour (or decant it through a strainer). With sparkling wine you need to be sure not to overfill. With most wines how you pour it makes no detectable difference on the flavor.

The actual answer to pouring is much less mystic and much more scientific. The pour does matter for several different reasons. 

First - Why does foaming occur? Carbon Dioxide is actually in solution inside of the beer. Several things play a factor; but, the biggest two are temperature and pressure. CO2 goes into solution easily around 36ºF (Here is a link to a slide that lists the temperature and PSI of beer). Therefore - the warmer the beer when poured, the more head you tend to get (because the CO2 is leaving solution). The other big reason is pressure differentials - inside the keg/can/bottle the pressure is keeping the CO2 in solution. When the pressure outside is less than in the keg (like when you open a beer bottle or pour the beer) the CO2 starts escaping.

The reason pour matters is really the following mixture of craftsmanship and business. 


Head retention (or the froth that stays at the top of your beer) is really important! It gives off a lot of aromatics that you get to experience before even tasting the beer. When you make beer - the hops added at the beginning of the process give the bittering falvors that balance the malty-sweetness while hops added toward the end (or even during fermentation) impart less bittering and more aromatics. Therefore, a lot of the beer's personality shines through the foamy-head. Let's be honest... what beer lover doesn't think that the way a freshly poured Left-Hand Nitro Stout (or other beers that have that tan-cascade of CO2 falling away from the head) is beautiful?
For businesses foamy-pours are money wasters. This link from TurboTapsUSA describes why their tap is a money saver. It comes down to lost beer. We know that a beer with foam 3 inches from the top turns into a beer with only about 1.5 inches of space from the top. So, when you see bartenders or others pouring until there is just beer to the top while foam pours out in the drain are just wasting money. 
Glass shape plays a big part in foaming. Nucleation sites help create carbonation (discussed at length in this forum). When you want a lot of head retention, this is a good thing. There is also a reason that glassware is shaped the way it is. It allows smells from the foam to be directed towards the imbiber's nose, allows the drink to breathe like wine, or keeps your hands from warming up the beer too much.

6784,2,,2017-04-19T07:14:46.557,1,,"This is a good question that a lot of people wonder about. Ordering whatever you like, as many of these answers say, is totally right, though I don't think that's the full story. The way that you order can help you build a relationship with your bartender (and other patrons), and that is always a good thing. An example of this is a  shot of a liqueur called Fernet Branca, a shot of Fernet for a while now has been known as the bartenders handshake (don't call it that when ordering, just ask for a shot of Fernet), it's a way to tell a bartender that you respect their craft. You can get any ol' beer to wash it down. Keep in mind though that Fernet tastes pretty terrible to most people the first time they try it.
The biggest thing I would say is to try new things, get to know what's out there. This will help you learn what you like and let's bartenders really flex their skill, and they love it... at cocktail bars, not so much at dive bars, but it sounds like you have a nice spot there. If you like Gin, google some classic gin drinks and try ordering them. Order an Army Navy, a Corpse Reviver #2, or a Hemingway Daiquiri for example. Keep in mind that you won't be know the difference between the drinks that your bartenders know and the ones that are obscure, until you get to know the lay of the land so just stay humble and keep to the really familiar drinks when the bartender is crazy busy. Also, feel free when it's not busy, to use adjectives to order... &quot;I want something sweet with whisky&quot; or &quot;something bitter and herbal&quot;. Keep the communication open, they know what they're doing.
Just to get the ball rolling for you, here are a few to start with....
Brandy Alexander is sweet and the perfect nightcap. An Amaretto Sour with a splash of bourbon, another easy going cocktail, it's a twist on a classic and created by one of the biggest names in the industry. A Negroni, it became super popular not long ago and has been a little bit over done since then but, you should order one and know what everyone went crazy over. Be ready, it'll be bitter.

  Kava drinks - often referred to as ""kava tea"" - are made from the roots of a plant grown in the South Pacific, and they're known for their purported anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects. 
  
  When ground up and mixed with water, the root turns into a juice that some claim can be a natural alternative to alcohol. It has been used for thousands of years as a ceremonial and social drink in the South Pacific. 
  
  Basically, the drink mimics alcohol's relaxing and sedative effects without the downsides - no extreme emotions, no memory loss, and no hangover.  Tech Insider previously reported on kava's key compound, kavain, which mimics a sedative and triggers relaxation in the body. It works as a muscle relaxer, so while you're mentally alert, you feel physically loose. 


Here is what Bulletproof has to say about Kava:


  Kava is like chamomile on steroids. This muddy-tasting little root comes from the Pacific Islands, where people have used it for centuries as everything from a pain reliever to a ceremonial drink. A potent anxiety reliever, kava offers a non-alcoholic way to wind down at the end of the day, especially if you’re working late or you have trouble falling asleep.
  
  The secret lies in kavalactones, the psychoactive parts of the kava plant. The kavalactones in a cup of kava tea, or a few drops of kava extract, can put you into a rare state of relaxed focus.

Brix Refractometer Measure Sugar content for Beer Wine 

It determines the sugar content not just in beers, but in wines as well (also fruits etc.).

What is a refractometer?


  A refractometer is an optical device that, like a hydrometer, measures the specific gravity of your beer or wort. It does so by sampling a small amount of liquid, and looking at its optically. The main advantage over a hydrometer is the small sample size needed – typically only a few drops.
  
  Most brewing refractometers measure samples in Brix, which is a scale used to measure specific gravity primarily by wine makers. Some also use a Refractive Index (RI) scale. Both the Brix and RI indexes need to be converted to standard specific gravity or Plato scales using a formula, as wort does not have the same reflective properties as plain sugar water.
  
  Using Your Refractometer when Beer Brewing
  
  Using the refractometer is very similar to what you just did when calibrating it. Open the sample plate, make sure it is clean and dry, then add a few drops of your wort. Again, if the wort is hot allow it to cool to room temperature first (ideally 68F). Close the sample plate, check for bubbles, and then hold the refractometer up to a natural light source.
  
  Reading the refractometer is easy – just take the reading directly from the sight scale. The reading you take will most likely be in percent/degrees Brix or RI. - How to Use a Refractometer, Brix and Beer Brewing

The biggest mineral difference is going to come from the water source of the brewery. Following the exact same formula recipe/mashing instructions/yeast used/fermentation conditions (temperature, altitude, fermentation vessel)/time/etcetera... you can get very different flavor beers if the water source is different. 

The next varying source of minerals would probably be in yeast. Unfortunately, I can only find evidence of all brewing yeast lumped together at the moment. 

The interesting part in craft brewing, especially at the homebrew-mad-science level, becomes all of the additives that can be placed into beer. I once met a brewer that dry-hopped smoked salmon bones (right they aren't hops but the same technique) in their secondary fermentation (or clarifying stage) chamber!

You can't actually tell what the sugar content is of a beer without knowing the Final Gravity of the wort before fermentation giving you the Original Gravity. These difference in OG-FG tell you the Alcohol By Volume of the beer in question. Specific gravity is measured in kg/(m^3) - I'm sure there is some math that could be done to figure out how to convert a known Final Gravity into know sugar amounts.


The downside becomes knowing what type of sugars were in the original recipe. Without knowing exactly what went into the beer (and recipes can be quite proprietary) - you'll be hard pressed to figure out exact sugar content.

In the wine industry it's pretty straight forward to measure residual sugar since all you are dealing with is leftover fructose from the unfermented portion of the wine. One sugar, easy. It's pretty accurate with a Clinitest (now Aimtabs). 

But with beer, it's different story because you are dealing with several types of sugars and frankly brewers don't have the same problems with unfermented sugars that winemakers do. (This is how we have fizzy wine!) So, finding a test for residual sugar in beer is not only more complicated but rare. 

You cannot use a refractometer or hydrometer to measure residual sugars directly since alcohol influences the end results. One method is to evaporate the alcohol content and then with the alcohol gone you could measure the sugars directly. This would have to be done with vacuum distillation so you don't lose the water content.

I did find an old paper from 1977 which describes several scientific methods but these are generally too hard for the average person to take on.

  Methods are reviewed for measuring total wort and beer carbohydrate and carbohydrate fractions, such as dextrins, oligosaccharides, fermentable sugars, jS-glucans, total  fructose and fructosans, pentose and pentosans. The methods are conveniently classified under the following headings: reductometry, colorimetry, enzymic procedures, automated analyses, paper and column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, gas liquid chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. Techniques involving chromatography are particularly useful for separating and estimating individual sugars.

So far these teas seem to be good options: 


Chamomile
Lavender
Mints
Valerian Root
Lemon Balm (mint family)


Update: I've also taken the suggestion in one of the other answers to try Tulsi, and this has turned out well. Where teas like Chamomile or Lavender are good sleep aids, Tulsi acts as more of a relaxant that can be drunk at different times of the day.

So far the teas seem to work out like this:


Lavender - sleep aid
Valerian - sleep aid
Chamomile - sleep aid
Mints - muscle and body relaxant
Tulsi - stress relief


Second Update:

I'm going to share another update here as this question is getting a lot of views, and I believe this information to be pertinent to the question.

In the past year I've not only been making use of sedatives, but have also been reducing the caffeine content I drink via coffee. To help cut back on caffeine I've been mixing caffeine-free coffee beans with regular ones, and gradually increasing the amount of caffeine-free beans in the mix. At this time I'm at about 25% regular / 75% caffeine free.

What's interesting to note about this is that since seriously cutting back on caffeine I've found that I no longer have much need for the sedative herbals I'd been drinking. As it turns out, once your body acclimates to not pumping itself with stimulants, there is less need for sedatives to calm yourself down at the end of the day.

6807,2,,2017-04-28T13:47:45.913,10,,"I think the first step in attempting to change a belief of another person is always to understand why they hold that view. That can even help with determining how likely you are to be successful. For example, if her concern is that you may be actively trying to poison her, you're probably not very likely to change her mind. But if instead her concern is just that you may screw up something and produce a contaminated and therefore unsafe drink, that may be easier to handle. But you would use a different argument than if her concern was that you obtained the ingredients from an untrusted source.

To address the latter two options, the simplest way may just be too brew your beer, drink in on several occasions, and then have your continued health be the evidence that it's not poisonous. This has the added benefit of checking it first to make sure it tastes reasonably good (poisonous or not if it doesn't come out well you may want to wait till next time to have her try it).

Attacking it from a more logical perspective, there are a few other arguments you can make:


Beer was, for quite some time, a product that was made more because it was safe to drink than because it was tasty. Not being able to trust their water sources, brewing beer was a way to make a drink that was not only less likely to make your sick but also an important source of nutrition.
From the research I've done, I couldn't find any instance of someone becoming dangerously sick from homebrew. Maybe the occasional upset stomach or bathroom problems but as long as you're being reasonable about cleaning and sanitizing the equipment an infected batch is almost certainly just a matter of it tasting bad, not a matter of your health.
A big part of the reason for the above points is that the alcohol produced during fermentation should be enough to inhibit the growth of any dangerous microorganisms. That should hold true for even extremely low ABV beers (&lt;1%).


Unless you're using dirty, hand-me-down equipment and either aren't cleaning it or aren't properly sanitizing it, you shouldn't​ be able to end up with anything dangerous*. Even then you're more likely to just end up with something you don't like. Long story short, if it tastes and smells good, you'll be fine.

* One caveat here: bottle grenades are a serious issue and can be dangerous. Make sure you clean and sanitize your bottles well and don't bottle until your beer has reached its final gravity. That said, this is more of a physical safety issue than something that makes the beer unsafe to drink.

  Recipe: Strawberry Habanero Margarita
  Ingredients


• ¼ cup Strawberry Habanero Simple Syrup
• ¼ cup Fresh Lime juice
• 4 ounces Grand Marnier
• 4 ounces Tequila
• Strawberry Habanero Simple Syrup:
• 1 cup sugar
• 1 cup water
• 1 cup strawberries
• 1 habanero with seeds



  Instructions for Strawberry Habañero Syrup: 


1. Bring everything to a simmer and let cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat.
2. Strain the syrup through a chinoise and reserve juice. Discard the berries and pepper.
3. Chill the syrup.



  Making the drink


1. Combine ice, the syrup, the lime juice and the liquor in a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake vigourously and then pour into a chilled ice filled glass.

6815,2,,2017-05-02T13:16:22.307,4,,"So, when I owned my winery (after 15 years I had to shut it down) I went through distributors and agents. Distributors typically buy the wine from me at a 50% discount from the retail price and then mark it up to the 30% discount mark and sell it to retail/restaurant at that price, where the retailer marks it up to to whatever they want. 

So, let say I have a $10 bottle of wine. I sell it to a distributor for $5. They mark it up to $7 and sell it to retail. Retailers usually will sell it for around 100% of the price you suggest. Restaurants sell at usually 200% of retail.

So, on a $10 bottle of wine the distributor is making $3 a bottle. That's what we have to work with. Of that $3 there are overhead costs, profits and % goes to the salesman. I once worked with a commission only wine sales guy and he was making 10% on a case of wine. So in our theoretical exercise he makes $1 a bottle or $12 a case. I think 10-12% is typical for commission only sales. 

Being a wine salesman is a tough business and it takes a lot of relationship building and cold calls and super thin margins. Good Luck!

  Sour mashing requires only a small deviation from your normal routine and has three goals:


 1. Create an optimal environment for Lactobacillus.

 2. Prevent spoiling organisms from producing foul aromatics and flavors.

 3. Drop pH to produce desired amount of acidity/sourness.



  The main difference between sour mashing and kettle souring is that sour mashing occurs before sparging with the mashed grains still present while kettle souring occurs after sparging with the full pre-boil volume (and frequently in the boil kettle). Additionally, sour mashing will have a moderately higher gravity because it is undiluted first runnings.



I assume the sour mashing aspect of this is what happens when distilling whiskey.

Can you find higher alcohol wines that are sweeter? Sure, dessert wines come to mind. Sauternes, Ice Wines, Tokay, Late Harvest wines are sweet with more alcohol.

We know that that Greek Alchemists developed the distillation processes about 1 AD and that a true distillation process was developed in Italy in the 1200s at the School of Salerno and Fractional Distillation was developed in the 1300s in Italy again. (Distilled Beverages Wikipedia) In 1313 there is evidence that Brandy had been made, although not widespread. 

Then it seems in the 1400s, the doors open wide across Europe for distilled spirits.


  Claims upon the origin of specific beverages are controversial, often
  invoking national pride, but they are plausible after the 12th century
  AD, when Irish whiskey and German brandy became available. These
  spirits would have had a much lower alcohol content (about 40% ABV)
  than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first
  thought of as medicinal elixirs. Consumption of distilled beverages
  rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when
  distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the Black Death.
  Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye
  beers, a cheaper option than grapes, were discovered. Thus began the
  ""national"" drinks of Europe: jenever (Belgium and the Netherlands),
  gin (England), Schnaps (Germany), grappa (Italy), borovička
  (Slovakia), horilka (Ukraine), akvavit/snaps (Scandinavia), vodka
  (Poland and Russia), ouzo (Greece), rakia (the Balkans), and poitín
  (Ireland). The actual names emerged only in the 16th century, but the
  drinks were well known prior to then. 


So, from about 500AD to 1300 AD, it was possible you could find distilled spirits, they were not widely available. Then in the 1300s distilled spirits spread across Europe and became widely available by the 1500s. Which one was actually the strongest? We'll never know but 90+% ABV was probably achievable with 1500s technology.

  The practice of making orange wines, despite its relative anonymity, spans centuries, dating all the way back to Eurasian wine production in Georgia (and we’re not talking the Peachtree State here). Much of the orange wine that is commercially distributed today comes from Italy (specifically its northeastern Friuli region), but other producers include France, Germany and California.

I doubt that storing tequila in your freezer will make it taste better, but under certain conditions it could preserve the great taste of tequila. Storing your liquor in general in a freezer is not a bad idea at all, but is only possibly necessary at certain times.


  For the most part, there’s no need to refrigerate or freeze liquor whether it’s still sealed or already opened.
  
  Hard liquors like vodka, rum, tequila, and whiskey; most liqueurs, including Campari, St. Germain, Cointreau, and Pimm’s; and bitters are perfectly safe to store at room temperature. Essentially every liquor mentioned in this Bar Cart post on stocking your home bar with the notable exception of already-opened vermouth can and should be stored without refrigeration.
  
  That notable exception of vermouth I mentioned above is because vermouth is actually a fortified wine. And like regular wine, it will eventually oxidize, so it needs to remain in the fridge once it’s been uncorked. Vermouth and dessert wines like vin santo, ice wine, and the like thankfully have a longer refrigerator shelf life than their regular wine counterparts, and won’t turn vinegary and sour in the span of a few days.

  Like almost any other alcohol (besides some liqueurs), tequila should be stored in a cool and dry area. Therefore, the pantry seems to be the best possible choice, but if you don’t plan to open the bottle within the next few weeks or months, you can store it in the cellar (if there’s not enough space in the pantry). After opening the bottle please remember that you should always keep the bottle tightly sealed when not in use. Don’t ever store it with a pourer on or without its cap.
  
  Tightly sealed bottle ensures two things. First – any impurities won’t be able to find their way into the bottle. Second – if the bottle stays opened without its cap, the liquid evaporates quicker than when it’s sealed. Because alcohol evaporates quicker than water, your tequila will slowly become milder with time (after opening the bottle for the first time).
  
  When the bottle is less than half full and you won’t consume the rest of its contents within a couple of weeks, it’s a good idea to pour the liquid into a smaller bottle. More air in the bottle equals faster evaporation and oxidation, both of them causing the quality of tequila to slowly deteriorate. 
  
  The  shelf life of tequila is indefinite if the seal remains undamaged. If not consuming your tequila in a relatively short time I would not hesitate to put it in the refrigerat
  
  First thing that not everyone is familiar with is that spirits, unlike wines, don’t age after being bottled. That means that storing tequila for years won’t make its taste better. When it comes to shelf life of tequila, it’s basically indefinite, as long as its seal isn’t compromised. If you store an unopened bottle in the pantry for quite a few years now, you can be almost sure that it’s fine now and it should be of great quality. After the bottle is opened for the first time, it’s recommended to drink tequila within a couple of months, when its quality is still at its best.


With freezing temperatures be sure your bottles will not explode.


  The average home freezer is about -17 C (-1 F). This is cold enough to freeze your food and ice, but not cold enough to freeze the average bottle of 80-proof liquor.
  
  ■ Storing your favorite bottle of vodka in the freezer is okay.

What are the qualitative and quantitative differences between inebriation caused by liquor wine and beer?


Anecdotal evidence suggests to me that the core difference between the three is that beer contains hops, while liquor/wine doesn't, and so beer tends to have a depressive + dis-inhibition effect, while liquor and wine provide the dis-inhibition effect without being an explicit depressant.

I wonder, though, has this ever been studied and concluded on? Are the differences that I mentioned above accurate? Are there any other differences?

Silence of the Lambs (1991) can be paired with Chianti and Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio.


  Alamo Drafthouse is releasing two wines that pay tribute to the classic killer chiller: Cannibal Chianti and Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio.
  
  Italian-grown Cannibal Chianti is a 85% Sangiovese blend with Canaiolo and Malvasia del Chianti, a DOCG wine from a vineyard between Florence and Sienna. Alamo notes that it has “savory plum and tobacco leaf notes.” Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio — a reference to “Lambs” killer Buffalo Bill’s penchant for wearing suits made of women’s skin — is a California wine from the Central Coast and inland vineyards with notes of “tropical peach and Mexican limes with just a hint of honey.” - Silence of the Lambs’ Wines From Alamo Drafthouse: Quaff Some Cannibal Chianti

Lecter says, ""A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti."" - Wines Made Famous by the Movies


Frankenstein (1931) or any Frankenstein movie may be paired with Francis Coppola Director’s Frankenstein Cabernet Sauvignon 2014 California.

It’s a bramble- and spice-packed blend of Zinfandel and Pinot Noir, masterfully blended with California rarities like Mourvèdre, Alicante Bouschet and Barbera and more. Winemaker Rob McNeill, of Sonoma’s famed Don Sebastiani &amp; Sons, gave this tempting potion further intrigue with a little oak aging.

  “Diamonds Are Forever”: My favorite Bond wine moment ever is when he uses two assassins’ ignorance about Bordeaux to out and wipe out the dastardly duo. So the tippling tout is the earthy but elegant Chateau D’Argadens Bordeaux Superiore.
  
  Goldfinger”: For me (and countless others), this is the perfect Bond film: nonpareil villain, thug and “Bond girls.” So we need a near-perfect wine; let’s splurge and go with the always-stellar Chateau de Beaucastel Châteauneuf-du-Pape. - What wine goes with each James Bond movie?

  Vodkabeer
  
  A delicious mixed drink comprised of beer (usually of the lowest quality) and vodka (always from a plastic handle). The vodka is poured directly into the beer can after several sips have been taken. The vodka and beer enhance each other's flavors and the result is a drink much greater than the sum of its parts.

6851,2,,2017-05-22T15:03:24.923,2,,"From 'Indians of North America' by Harold Driver.

The distribution of alcoholic beverages falls almost wholly within the bounds of horticulture. However, there was a sizeable area in Northeast Mexico which was without agriculture and where wine was made from wild plants. For the world as a whole, there is a definite correlation between alcoholic beverages and agriculture, although negative instances can also be found in the Old World. The explanation is a simple one--the liquors were made principally from domesticated plants. It is commonly assumed either that knowledge of the fermenting of these plants spread with the plants or that the making of the liquor from the plant could spread only as far as the plant was known.
e.g. Agave and Dasylirion -- Two distinct plants were widely used in the Southwest, Meso-America, and Northeast Mexico for the production of alcoholic beverages. They were even more widely used as food. It has been conjectured that before the time when agriculture was common, say, in the second or third millennium BC these plants were a staple food or even the staple food of a large part of the region. In the Southwest, the wine was usually made from the cooked juice of the agave, not from the fresh juice as in Meso-America.

So from this I'm going to infer that technologically most native tribes who knew of fermentation would have been restricted to that form of alcohol production, and so wine would be the only form of alcohol available pre-European contact. It's also safe to say that wine production only occurred within cultures that had ferment-able produce available to them.

6852,2,,2017-05-22T15:13:44.507,2,,"Prior to 1492 Native Americans actually brewed various alcoholic drinks.


  Prior to contact with colonists, alcohol use and production was mainly concentrated in the southwestern United States. Some tribes produced weak beers, wine and other fermented beverages, but they had low alcohol concentrations (8%-14%) and were to be used only for ceremonial purposes. The distillation technique required to make stronger, potent forms of alcohol were unknown. It was well documented that Mexican Native Americans prepared over forty different alcoholic beverages from a variety of plant substances, such as honey, palm sap, wild plum, and pineapple. In the Southwestern U.S., the Papago, Piman, Apache and Maricopa all used the saguaro cactus to produce a wine, sometimes called haren a pitahaya. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with the Agave plant to create an alcoholic drink, and the Pueblos and Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitahaya and even grapes. To the east, the Creek of Georgia and Cherokee of the Carolinas used berries and other fruits to make alcoholic beverages, and in the Northeast, there is some evidence that the Huron made a mild beer made from corn. In addition, despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Alaska were believed to have made alcoholic drinks from fermented berries. - Alcohol and Native Americans (Wikipedia)


Various Indian culture brewed different drinks according to what was available in the local areas.


  In Mexico, some believe Native Americans used a corn precursor to make a brewed drink; they note: “the ancestral grass of modern maize, teosinte, was well suited for making beer – but was much less so for making corn flour.” In addition, it is well established that Mexican Native Americans prepared “over forty different alcoholic beverages [from] . . . a variety of plant substances, such as honey, palm sap, wild plum, and pineapple.”
  
  In the Southwestern U.S., the Papago, Piman, Apache and Maricopa all used the saguaro cactus to produce a wine, sometimes called haren a pitahaya. Similarly, the Apache fermented corn to make tiswin (also called tulpi and tulapai) and the yucca plant to make a different alcoholic beverage.
  
  The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with the Agave plant to create an alcoholic drink, and the Pueblos and Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitahaya and even grapes.

  It should be noted, however, that most of these beverages were relatively weak, presumably no stronger than wine (which typically runs from 8-14% ABV). Whiskey, on the other hand, is usually 60% ABV, and grain alcohol (e.g., moonshine) is often 95% ABV. As a result, when Europeans introduced these stronger drinks, Native Americans were in for a shock. - Native Americans Were Not Introduced to Alcohol By Europeans


The Pueblo Indians actually brewed their own brand of corn beer.


  Ancient Pueblo Indians brewed their own brand of corn beer, a new study suggests, contradicting claims that the group remained dry until their first meeting with the Europeans. 
  
  Archaeologists recently found that 800-year-old potsherds belonging to the Pueblos of the American Southwest contained bits of fermented residue typical in beer production. 
  
  Before the discovery, historians thought a pocket of Pueblos in New Mexico did not have alcohol at all, despite being surrounded by other beer-making tribes, until the Spanish arrived with grapes and wine in the 16th century.
  
  A thousand years ago, traditional Native American farming villages were already scattered across parts of New Mexico, Arizona and northern Mexico, divided among several tribes including the Apache, Pueblo, Navajo and the Tarahumara. 
  
  Many of the tribes living in Mexico and some in Arizona are known to have produced a weak beer called tiswin, made by fermenting kernels of corn, but no evidence has ever been found that the same thing happened in New Mexico. - Beer Brewed Long Ago by Native Americans

  In South and Central America, chicha is a fermented or non-fermented beverage usually derived from maize.1[need quotation to verify] Chicha includes corn beer known as chicha de jora and non-alcoholic beverages such as chicha morada. Archaeobotanists have found evidence for chicha made from maize, the fruit of Schinus molle and Prosopis pods.2 Chichas can also be made from quinoa, kañiwa, peanut, manioc root (also called yuca or cassava), palm fruit, potato, Oxalis tuberosa, chañar or various other fruits.2
  While chicha is most commonly associated with maize, the word is used in the Andes for almost any homemade fermented drink, and many unfermented drinks.[3] Many different maize landraces, grains or fruits have been and can be used to make chicha in different regions.2 The way in which chicha is made and defined is likely to change depending on the region[4]


There is a native Brazilian drink called Cauim made from Manioc root:


  Cauim preparation (like other cooking tasks) is strictly a women's job, with no involvement from the men. Manioc roots are sliced thin, boiled until tender, and allowed to cool down. Then women and girls gather around the pot; each repeatedly takes a mouthful of manioc, chews it, and puts it into a second pot (depending on the culture). Enzymes in the saliva then convert the starch into fermentable sugars. (Men firmly believe that if they were to chew the paste, the resulting beverage would not taste as good; and anyway they consider that work as inappropriate for them as spinning yarn would be for European men.) The chewed root paste is put back on the fire and stirred with a wooden spoon until completely cooked. The paste is then allowed to ferment in large earthenware pots (""half as big as a Burgundy wine barrel"").


There are more, but these are probably the most well known from South America.

Why does this help? Because there are no known pathogens that can live in acidic solutions, and citrus, vinegar and tomatoes all have relatively low pH. 

And this is why home brewing is a safe pastime: wort is naturally too acidic to support pathogen growth. Any microorganisms that grow in wort are safe to consume. Most of them will affect the flavor of the beer, and that is why we do our best to control them, but none of them can harm you.

Here is what Jared Brandt says about orange wines:


  ""Orange wines fill in the gaps when pairing, because you get the acidity of a white and the tannins of a red,"" says Jared Brandt of Donkey &amp; Goat winery in Berkeley, California. Last fall, he and his wife, Tracey, released a cloudy orange wine: a floral, spicy Roussanne. ""We recently had a tofu dish that a red wine would have obliterated, and a rich lamb dish that would have overwhelmed a white,"" Brandt says. He opted to pair both with an orange wine from Friuli's Stanko Radikon, one of Gravner's acolytes, and it worked brilliantly.
  
  Some people might argue that rosé can be just as versatile with food as an orange wine. Pax Mahle, who makes an orange Pinot Gris under his Wind Gap Wines label, replies that orange wines are funkier tasting (and thus more interesting) than rosés.

Matthew Latkiewicz has these foods to pair with orange wine:


  But here’s what to do: Drink some orange wine along with food. Orange wines are all over the place from a flavor standpoint, so there’s no go-to rule for pairing it, but unlike a lot of white wines, which get bowled over by strong food flavors, orange wine has the structure and acidity from the skins to stand up to strong dishes while still retaining the spectrum of white-wine flavors. Without getting too wonky about the pairing-speak, know that you can also ditch fish-with-white, meat-with-red thinking; orange wine is a lot more versatile. For example, a bottle of Angiolino Maule Sassaia, which tastes almost nutty, can holds its own against something like grilled hanger steak; and that Vinujancu had a lot of qualities of a funky craft beer; it’d be great at cutting through fatty dishes — or anything with bacon. - Sloshed: How to Enjoy Orange Wine, the Indie Darling of the Wine World

In this article, David Mercer claims that ""Primates in Guinea drank fermented palm sap using a leafy tool as a sponge.""


  Scientists have discovered a group of booze-loving apes who may hold the key to why humans enjoy drinking alcohol.
  
  Experts say they have found the first empirical evidence of “long term and recurrent ingestion of ethanol” among apes in nature.
  
  hey observed wild chimpanzees in the town of Bossou in Guinea, west Africa, over 17 years and watched as the primates drank fermented palm sap using a leafy tool as a sponge.
  
  The chimpanzees consumed the alcoholic beverage, often in large quantities, despite an alcohol presence of up to 6.9 per cent ABV - the equivalent of a strong ale, according to a study published by the Royal Society.
  
  The amount of alcohol ingested ranged from about 2.5 to 84ml and there was no difference between males and females.
  
  Experts said that, unlike other examples of primates ingesting alcohol, such as introduced green monkeys targeting tourist cocktails in the Caribbean, the chimpanzees' attraction to fermented palm sap at Bossou was not a result of provisioning by local people.

In fact, most beverages labeled non-alcoholic contain 0.5% ABV as it is more profitable than distilling it to 0.05% ABV often found in products sold by companies specializing in non-alcoholic beverages.


There are many stories about deer, bear and other wild animals getting drunk on apples that have fallen and rotted on the ground. Do animals get drunk


  “I’ve watched white-tailed deer eating fermented apples in orchards,"" Moore says. They get pretty “sleepy,” even “stumble-y.” It’s a common observation in apple-growing regions, he adds.


But I think you want to know if there are naturally occurring drinks other than eating a bunch of rotten fruit and there are only a couple of that I have heard of and the one you mention in your question was one and the other was naturally occurring mead which happens when water gets into a beehive with honey in the comb. Honey fermenting in the comb


  To produce honey, bees collect nectar from flowers and add enzymes from their honey stomachs. Once the mixture is stored in cells, the bees fan it with their wings until it dehydrates to a moisture content of about 16 to 18.5 percent. If the moisture content is higher than that, the bees simply won’t cap it. If cold weather arrives before the honey is capped, it will sit open in the hive and may eventually ferment.

And other than prohibiting contamination with proven poisonous chemicals, there seem to be very few laws in making wine in most countries, I believe the same goes for American wine. It's allowed to boil wood chips and mix the extract with the wine to create a woody flavour, for instance, forget about rising in casks.

These are then infused into eau-de-vie (Unaged Brandy), although this part of the process is not well elucidated by the company. The spirit is then sweetened lightly, but is said to contain less sugar than a typical liqueur. The liqueur is then bottled.

Then it wouldn't be watered down by melting ice, and be cool enough from the moment the bartender is done pouring it.

Cursory research says repeated temperature change may alter certain alcohols' flavor, but then for other spirits it doesn't seem to be a problem, so that's ambiguous. However, at a regular bar's rate of consumption, I suppose there wouldn't be enough time for a bottle to go bad − it would be empty before then. Or maybe the effect is so strong that even one cycle of temperature change is enough. I don't know.

My question is: Why most alcohols which become drinks into which ice is usually put, are not stored in a fridge instead, so that the ice isn't needed?

6874,2,,2017-06-01T00:01:27.567,5,,"I can only speak for whiskies as I use to sell and give out samples of that stuff.

There are a couple of things to understand first about whiskies.


During the aging process of the whisky, the whisky is placed in a barrel to add flavour to it.
If the alcohol percent is below 40%, the whisky has a hard time retaining the flavour of the barrel. This is not impossible but it is easier if it is 40% or higher.


The reason why there is on the rocks vs neat is due to this 40% alcohol threshold. 

If you add ice, it will dilute the whisky below 40% alcohol content which will allow the flavours to ""pop out"" more. This is really good for new whisky drinkers trying to understand ""how to taste"" whiskies. 

So for whiskies, it is not so much about cooling the drink but rather allowing the flavours of the barrel to be more prominent to the drinker. For veteran whisky drinkers, they may not need the ice and prefer it at room temperature and thus, they would not want it cold.

6875,2,,2017-06-01T02:44:51.983,1,,"The problem you have is implied in the question: 'affordable' and 'good' Scotch don't really go hand in hand, depending on what you mean by affordable. It's not a matter of brands, it's a matter of the average entry-point for a quality product, which is surprisingly consistent. If a distillery produces a good whisky, they are going to price it according to it's quality.

In Canada, you can typically expect any bottle that costs over about 65 CDN to be what I'd call a good, drinkable Scotch. A good metric to go by is the price of a Glenmorangie Original, or Aberlour 12. These are two starter Scotches, and most bottles at or above their price point will be what I'd call a decent whisky.

Once you get under the prices of those two bottles you'll start seeing a hit in quality, and if you get significantly lower, like 30-40 you're talking an entire tier down.

That said one recommendation to look into is 'McClelland's'. It's most certainly not a premium Scotch, but it does perform well above it's price point.

Another recommendation I'd make is if entry-level and above Scotches are too expensive for you then check out some bourbon and Irish whiskies. Black Bush, Writer's Tears, and Bulleit Bourbon or Rye are quite drinkable whiskies for a much better price.

FWIW, I'd also hazard against the Glenfiddich 12 recommendation above, it is affordable but is a notoriously weak Scotch.

There are several sub categories of Late Harvest, which include Ice Wine, Botrytized, sun dried (raisined) and regular late harvest.

One of the better known of the late harvest wines is Sauternes. These are wines picked after the grapes have gotten moldy. (AKA Noble Rot) The mold acts to dry out the grapes making them like raisins. These wines are from white grapes mainly. In Hungary they are from Tokay. In the Alsace they are called Sélection de Grains Nobles (selection of the noble berries). The mold concentrates the sugars and adds it's own special flavor.

Ice Wine In certain places in the world, like Canada, USA and Germany the grapes need to be naturally frozen on the vine to be called Ice Wine this is the law. The temperature varies but somewhere around -7f to -10f before they are allowed to be picked. It's a crap shoot since you are not assured you will get that cold in the winter following harvest. So it is rare. They need to use special hydraulic presses since you are pressing the sugar out of little round ice balls. Sugar levels are so high that the yeast cannot complete fermentation leaving residual sweetness after fermentation. 

Iced Wine In many parts of the world there is no regulation around the word ""ice wine"" and many wine makers just take grapes and throw them in a huge freezer and mechanically freeze them called cryoextraction. Since they can't legally use the term ""Ice Wine"" without freezing them on the vine, they had to come up with a made up name. Iced Wine is one of those names. Frostbitten Ice Wine is a proprietary name from winemaker here in Washington State

6886,2,,2017-06-05T12:51:35.043,2,,"As a bartender and bar manager for 10+ years at a very busy bar several reasons are obvious to me.

Not everyone wants a cold drink.  It is easy to chill warm liquor quickly.  On the other hand there is no readily available method to warm chilled liquor.

As for having a copy of each liquor on display/ room temperature, logistically and financially it's infeasible for most bars/ restaurant and massively inefficient for larger establishments or commercial chains.

In your mind's eye picture how many bottles you might see on display, then picture how much space you need to store them.  Another problem becomes apparent.  On display there may be 30-100 bottles of liquor lined up in a way that their labels are visible.  

This does not maximize storage space, but having the label visible serves two primary purposes:
1. Customers can easily see what's available and
2. Perhaps more importantly, especially for busy bars, the bartender can quickly find and grab a bottle when needed.

If the bottles are stored in fridges, either top or front open, they will need to be stored one in the front of the other to best fill the space.

An important axiom in restaurants is that your peak business is constrained by how many customers you can serve at once. Having to open doors every time you wish to pour a drink is a massive time sink. Perhaps if only 1 or 2 drinks were made every 10 minutes then it would be trivial, but if bartender needs to make 3+ drinks a minute(and a good owner will build to support busy times), or if 3 or more bartenders need to do this, then the 4-30 seconds seconds it takes to open the door find the the bottle, and/or clear bar path obstructions this causes add up to massive increases in wait time.

Moderately Busy bar with well-skilled bartenders scenario:
4 bartenders making 3 drinks each per minute = ~12 customers served per minute.
Goal- guests greeted in 30 seconds, drinks delivered with a minute of greet time.  Why? This is roughly the time window for someone to feel they got great bar service.  This is a widely upheld service standard.  

Each drink takes 20 seconds to make.  Add 4 seconds to each drink and also assume that sometimes there will be wait at the door to get the correct liquor, or the open door is blocking the path.

Possible cost of having a door: the door can add (3 drinks x 4 seconds)x 3 bartenders = 36 seconds every minute to each bartender. More than a 50% increase to serve 12 customers. The service standard can not be met and the number of people served per minute with the same staff falls considerably to ~7 (12/96=.125 guests per second *60 seconds = 7.5 guests per minute) 

This could problem could be mitigated by increasing the size of the bar to hold shallow, but long refrigerators that have sliding doors and allow for alcohol to be seen and easily grabbed.  However, this does not solve the problem of people who don't want ice and it costs a considerable amount more in square footage, and refrigeration cost.  

And of course all of these concerns are easily answerable with using scooped ice versus refrigerators.  Scooped ice is elegant, refrigerating all the bottles is a kluge. 

Good logistics and bar design do a lot of work towards serving customers in a bar and towards reaching profitability.  With elite logistics you only need average bartenders to create excellent service.  Add elite bartenders to elite logistics and you create world-class service.  On the other hand poor logistics can make elite bartenders seem only average and make average bartenders nearly worthless.

One last thing: Adding ice adds to perceived value with very little relative cost. The glass size can be doubled and still be filled with the same amount of liquor.  While in truth you are getting the same volume of alcohol and/or mixer it appears like you are getting more add the cost of a penny or less for the ice.

  Pálinka is a traditional fruit brandy in the Carpathian Basin, known under several names, and invented in the Middle Ages. Protected as a geographical indication of the European Union, only fruit spirits mashed, distilled, matured and bottled in Hungary and similar apricot spirits from four provinces of Austria can be called ""pálinka"". 


The question is, how is this spirit most commonly consumed in this region? Is it usually drunk neat/on rocks or do Hungarians usually mix it into cocktails?

6896,2,,2017-06-10T11:58:24.453,3,,"How do Hungarians drink Palinka?


  Pálinka should be served at 18–20 °C (64–68 °F) because it is at this temperature that the fine smell and taste of the fruit can be best enjoyed. If served too cold, the smell and the taste will be difficult to appreciate.
  
  The form of the glass used to drink pálinka affects the drinking experience. The ideal glass is wide at the bottom and narrow at the rim, that is, tulip-shaped. The relatively narrow neck of the glass concentrates the ""nose"" released from the larger surface at the bottom of the glass, magnifying the smell of the drink. - Pálinka (Wikipedia).




Pálinka  in Tulip Glasses served Sausages

It is traditionally drank in a tulip glass, straight and not mixed in one shot or sipped a little at a time. To truly appreciate Pálinka, it should 


  Tips for Drinking Pálinka:
  
  
  Know your pálinka!: Kisüsti (meaning ‘a small pot’) is a double-distilled pálinka made in a copper pot. Érlelt (meaning ‘aged’) is a pálinka aged for at least three months in a wooden cask. Ó (meaning ‘old’) is aged for at least 12 or 24 months depending on the size of the cask. Ágyas (meaning ‘bedside’) is aged for at least three months together with fruit. Törköly (pomace pálinka) is made from grape pomace. It’s actually one of the oldest types of pálinka and it supposedly helps digestion.
  
  
  •It’s best to serve (and consume) at room temperature in a tulip-shaped shot glass. This temperature maintains the flavours of the fruits.
  
  •There is no strict rule or tradition when to drink it however as Hungarian cuisine tends to be on the heavy side it’s good to have a shot (…or two) prior to a meal…and then close the meal off with another one (…or two).
  
  •It’s not compulsory to drink it in one go…. said no Hungarian ever! However we are lenient with foreigners so drink it slow!
  
  •It WILL burn your throat: don’t worry, that’s normal.
  
  •The most popular flavours are apricot, plum, pear, cherry, grape and apple however flavours such as elderflower, quince and all sorts of berries are starting to become more popular. - How to Drink: Pálinka


Pálinka is generally not mixed.


  Though some mixologists are experimenting with adding pálinka to their cocktails, you’ll usually find it served on its own. The wince you’ll make in anticipation as you catch a whiff of your shot is all part of the fun, as is the expected slamming of your glass onto the table once you’ve finished your drink. - Hungary’s Water of Life


And again:


  Pálinka should be served somewhere between 10 - 15 °C. While many drink it as a shot, the more traditional Hungarians will drink it as a low drink, sort of like whisky. Don’t be surprised if you hear people shouting ‘Isten, Isten’ (God, God) before drinking it, that is just part of the Pálinka tradition. - Pálinka - The Hungarian Whisky


Hungarians love to eat sausages with their Pálinka, as can be seen at their Budapest Pálinka and Sausage Festival.


  Sausage and pálinka go well together, so be sure to visit one of the sausage stands and sample their homemade products, such as Gyulai and Csabai kolbász. - Budapest Pálinka and Sausage Festival

  So consider something from a cool-climate region, because cooler spots produce grapes with high acid: Germany's subtle, beautifully balanced dessert rieslings; a demi-sec (medium) champagne; or frothy, honeyed Italian moscati d'asti.

If the winemakers want to make a sweet wine, they must artificially halt the fermentation process by either increasing or decreasing the temperature in the fermentation tank to a certain level in which the yeasts cannot survive. Manipulating the temperature kills the yeast (well, actually they lay dormant) and it allows natural sugar to be left in the wine. The high sugar concentration of the grape plays a role, too. 

There is a second way to artificially halt the fermentation process, it is called fortification. Winemakers will add alcohol during the fermentation process to a level in which the yeasts cannot survive, also leaving natural sugar in the wine. 

And by the way, Moscato is purposefully made in a sweet style which is why it is always sweet.

kombucha, if you want something fun, which typically isn't part of a traditional religion (that I know of), but read the article. It's pretty funny.

No, leave the apples alone until fermentation is done.
No, the alcohol will stop any rotting. Your mead might be spoiled from another source of contamination (remember good sanitation) but as long as there is alcohol the apples won't rot.
It is advisable to move the mead from the fermentation vessel to a second one for aging. Mead is more like wine than beer and will benefit from some aging and clarification in a second vessel. This would involve leaving the fruit behind.
While it's not 100% necessary to add sulfites (campden tablets) to you mead, it will preserve and protect it from oxidation. Like wine they should be added when you move it to the second vessel for aging.

6931,2,,2017-06-26T12:49:22.413,9,,"A distillery is just a building at the end of a day, the flavor of a whiskey comes from the ingredients and equipment used inside it. In whiskey making the equipment used makes a big difference in the end product, here's a non-exhaustive list:


Stills: stills are used to concentrate alcohol, the shape and material used for stills make a great difference in the end flavor of the whiskey
Barrels: whiskey is aged for years, generally in barrels of some kind. The material used can make a big difference, for instance there's charred barrels, used wine or port barrels. The whiskey will take flavors from the barrel as it ages


The ingredients that are used in whiskey making likewise make a big difference:


Grain: Barley, Rye, Wheat and Corn are all used in whiskey making, and each give whiskey a very different character
Peat: peat smoke is widely used in scottish whiskey making, the amount and type of peat used gives the end product more or less flavor 
Yeast: the strain of yeast used in the fermentation will have an impact on flavor


There's also conditions to consider like the temperature and length of the initial fermentation, still heat, etc. There's the number of times that a whiskey is distilled, triple distillation would give a very different character than double distilling. These are all under control and change the end product. 

So a distiller with a single set of equipment using the same grain could make many different characters of whiskey by varying the process and types of barrel used. If they have different stills and use different grains a single distillery could make a very wide variety of whiskeys. 

As for this specific case, Blanton is a brand which is named after Albert Blanton, one of the founders of the Buffalo Trace distillery and who worked there for more than 5 decades. The same company (Sazerac) owns several distilleries and produces many different brands. For all I know they do just pour standard Buffalo Trace into the bottles and market it as something else, it wouldn't be the first time a company pulled that trick, however that would be bound to be noticed by aficionados and it wouldn't do their reputation any good.

I would assume what's happening is that specific distilleries have the capacity to produce a certain quantity of whisky, but the market for an individual brand is lesser than this quantity. So instead of producing a larger quantity of a single brand, they produce slightly different whiskies under different names to encourage the consumer to buy more. After all, it makes more sense to have three different whiskies, than three bottles of the same whisky.

When it comes to mass-produced bourbons you're not going to see a heck of a lot of difference between different varieties, so if you're set on that style I'd recommend just picking one that's somewhere in the middle of the price range (not on the bottom of the barrel, but also not artificially priced as a 'premium' product). FWIW, my go to bourbon is 'Bulleit'.

Another avenue you could take is to go for some entry-level scotches, something like a Glenmorangie Original. It might be a bit higher priced than bourbon, but you're going to get a better whisky.

A tiny lemon juice (some drops) over the strawberries also adds some refreshing taste.

The only way to price a rare item like this without selling it is to mark it to market. You need to find a number of comparable bottles of special edition beers with similar collectors' markets and use the prices of those bottles to calculate the current price of that bottle. The more similar the comparable bottles are in terms of time since sale, qualities of the beer (style, ABV etc.), number of bottles produced and size of ""following"" or number of collectors, the closer your price will be to a realistic price. If it were really valuable an auction house such as Sotheby's or Christie's could be employed to do the calculations for you as they are quite involved. Note that marking to market only gives a guideline price at a moment in time as prices can fluctuate wildly in collectables markets. 

The basis of this pricing model is the pricing of any liquid commodity or financial instrument.

6938,2,,2017-06-30T17:37:46.107,4,,"Gin is very simply defined as


  a clear alcoholic spirit distilled from grain or malt and flavoured with juniper berries.


So your differentiation between ""made properly"" and ""just alcohol and flavor"" is meaningless.

Many of the finest gins are made by steeping juniper berries and other botanicals in the distilled spirit. Others are created by passing the newly formed vapour through a ""botanicals basket"" prior to condensation. Whichever way they are created, they are still gin.

So all the ones in your picture are ""proper"" gins. Many of them are really nice (that Caorunn is good.)

  Why Red Wine Stains
  
  Strong pigments in red wine are instant stain-makers for porous surfaces like your teeth. These pigments, called chromogens, give it that deep, intense hue, and leave their mark on your teeth after just a few sips. The nature of enamel plays a big part in this process.
  ""Enamel isn't perfectly smooth,"" says Benjamin Rudow, D.D.S. ""It has small cracks and irregularities, and pigmentation from red wine will settle in them


So you need to seek out wines that have the highest amount of tannins possible. Your run of the mill grocery store wines will not have a lot of tannins because it's more work and that makes the wines more expensive. Wines meant to age a long time will usually have more tannins since they help buffer the effects of oxidation and help the wine last longer.

So, really you want expensive, long lived, tannic wines. Those would be Cabernet, Petit Sirah, Tempranillo, Nebbiolo. But if you really want to go full stain, try a Tannat wine. It will stain your lips, gums, teeth and tongue! It's hard to find a 100% Tannat, but there are some that make it.

Tablas Creek in California makes a 100% Tannat that I've had before and it will stain like nobody's business!

You could try reading http://theginisin.com/ and getting a feel for if you agree with the reviewer based on what you currently like, then use his reviews as a jumping off point either positively or negatively.

However, I believe that the only truly valid way it to try them.  That said if your mixing the gin with tonic(and perhaps a lime), there is probably very little chance you can taste the difference.

Many people think they are alcohol connoisseurs, but in truth very few are -it take real practice and training.  This idea has fascinated me for a long time and working over a decade behind a bar has given me insight.  It rings true for every kind of alcohol, varietal of wine, and type of beer.  Most people can not tell the difference.  What I have here is anecdotal, but perhaps it can help to inform you.

I worked at a square bar with a partition in the middle(you could not see across the bar completely).  On occasion we would run out of something, bud light, Kendall Jackson, Patron, Crown, Tanqueray, Grey Goose etc.  If it wasn't too busy, On the order side of the bar, I would make the person something similar: miller light instead of bud, Cuervo Silver instead of patron, Rail gin instead of Tanqueray, smirnoff instead of Grey Goose.  I would let them try it for a bit and then have another bartender ask what they were drinking under some pretense.  

Never once did anyone notice or at least speak up, and this happened easily more than 100 times.  Afterwards I would tell them my ""mistake"" and offer to not charge them for the drink or buy them a round of the correct brand.

Less often, but still on occasion(dozens of times) I would hear someone talking about how only brand X will do and everything else is trash.  I would tell them that I don't think they can tell the difference and that I was willing to make a bet.  Their humiliation against a free drink.  I would fill 3 small glasses with enough liquor for a taste.  I would then put the bottle for their brand and two other bottles of a similar liquor in front of them.  

The bet? They have to tell me what liquor is in each glass.  If they can, then they get a free shot(or sometimes more than one), if they can't they have to admit they can't tell the difference.

I would fill all three glasses with their favorite brand(never said I would use all three bottles).  If there was a mixer involved, not a single person figured it out, even though a very large portion of players were certain they were right.  If the liquor was straight up, then about 10% - 15% could figure it out.

I'm not saying there are no taste differences between gins- there are. For the uninitiated though, they are difficult to detect straight. When you mix it with tonic(or another mixer) many of the differences are completely lost and only practiced connoisseurs will be able to detect what they are specifically drinking.  Based on your question, it does not appear you fall into this category(most of us don't).

Mostly what you are getting with a certain brand is a feeling from ordering it, not a distinct flavor profile.  In that light, let go of the importance of taste and try to consider feeling. Ask yourself, what feeling are you trying to get for yourself?  You want the bartender to think well of you?  You want to feel like you are drinking something made with high quality methods? You want to feel superior to others? You want to recapture a memory?  You want to seem cool? You want to impress someone?  You want to feel like you are getting your money's worth?  Want to spend as little/ as much as possible?

Let the feeling you are chasing help you choose the right brand.  Alternatively, you could go about tasting all of these gins in order to gain the actual skill to know the difference.  However, this will take years and doesn't have much use in regular bar drinking.

These stereotypes may very by locale, but just as a starting point:
Want to seem urban tough, try Tanqueray.
Want to seem urban sophisticated, try Tanqueray 10
Want to seem like you know a good classic, try Saffire.
Want to show working class grit, try beef eaters or gordon's or rail.
Want to seem informed or hip (depending on whats available), try Caorunn, Hendrix, or anything local or ""small batch"".

I expect I may get some kickback from some folks about difficulty of tasting the difference and I say to you prove me wrong.  Perform a blind taste test- mark the bottom of the glass with a label facing down and make sure to put multiples of the each brand in order to make sure you actually able to tell the difference and not just guessing correctly.

Also, here is a link to relevant article(for wine not gin) that concludes that people can not tell the difference in brands.

What is gin?


  Gin is a spirit which derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (Juniperus communis). From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, gin has evolved from use in herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin was developed on the basis of the older jenever, and became popular in Great Britain (particularly in London) when William of Orange, leader of the Dutch Republic, occupied the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones with his wife Mary. Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, represented by products of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.


What is a liqueur?


  A liqueur is an alcoholic beverage made from a distilled spirit that has been flavored with fruit, cream, herbs, spices, flowers or nuts and bottled with added sugar or other sweetener (such as high-fructose corn syrup). Liqueurs are typically quite sweet; they are usually not aged for long after the ingredients are mixed, but may have resting periods during their production to allow flavors to marry.


What is a liquor?


  A distilled beverage, spirit, liquor, hard liquor or hard alcohol is an alcoholic beverage produced by distillation of grains, fruit, or vegetables that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation. The distillation process purifies the liquid and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its proportion of alcohol content (commonly expressed as alcohol by volume, ABV).1 As distilled beverages contain more alcohol, they are considered ""harder"" – in North America, the term hard liquor is used to distinguish distilled beverages from undistilled ones.


On the web one can see that there generally five types of gin. However Canada and the USA recognize only 3 types of gin (Genever, Gin, London or Dry gin), while the  European Union recognizes 4 types (Juniper-flavoured spirit drinks, Gin, Distilled gin and London gin).

Here are the different types of gins that can be found around the world and what makes them a certain style of gin.


  
  London Dry Gin is what most people think of as “gin.” They are typically very dry, heavily juniper flavored, light in body, and aromatic. To get the flowery, botanical flavor, this style of gin is typically infused with various aromatic ingredients during the 2nd or 3rd distillation process, giving each brand its own unique taste. London dry gin doesn’t have to be made in London and most aren’t. If you’re at the store, common brands include Tanqueray, Bombay Sapphire, and Beefeater. This style is great for classic martinis, gin and tonics, and Aviation cocktails.
  Plymouth Gin is a less dry cousin to London Dry Gin that must be made in Plymouth, England. Infused with more roots, this style of gin has an earthier flavor with softer juniper notes than other styles. Currently, there is only one brand of Plymouth gin produced in the world and, wouldn’t you know it, it’s called Plymouth. It can be used anywhere a London Dry Gin is used.
  Genever or Dutch gin is very different in color and taste to the other types of gins. Unlike most gins which are made with a combination of cereal grains, genever is made from a base of malt grains which gives it a darker color and flavor that is more similar to a light-bodied, botanical whiskey. Recently, genever has been revived by craft mixologists who are using it creatively in cocktails, but it is just as good for sipping straight or chilled. The most commonly available brand is Bols Genever.
  Old Tom Gin is a sweeter cousin to London Dry Gin and is appropriately names as it was the preferred gin in a Tom Collins. It’s often thought of as somewhere in between a London Dry Gin and Genever. It can be difficult to find but look for the Hayman’s brand. Old Tom Gin is most famously used in the Tom Collins and Martinez cocktails but is also delicious in a Ramos Gin Fizz.
  New American or International Style Gin is an umbrella term used to refer to all of the new styles of gin that use the same base distilling process but are predominantly infused with flavors other than juniper berries. The most common one you might be familiar with is Hendrick’s, flavored with cucumber and rose. - The 4 (and Maybe 5) Types of Gin
  


A sixth type of gin is the Sloe Gin and is considered by some to be a liqueur and not a liquor because of the amount of sugar added to it.


  Sloe Gin: A historic style, with neither legal nor geographic protection, sloe gin is a flavored gin, using sloe, or blackthorn, berries, along with sugar. Sloe gin is more of a fruit cordial or a liqueur than it is a true gin, and in fact, some bottom-shelf sloe gins are made not with gin at all but with vodka. - The Serious Eats Guide to Gin

6981,2,,2017-08-05T20:25:31.397,5,,"Malbec is a French wine and at one point was grown in 30 different departments of France, a legacy that is still present in the abundance of local synonyms for the variety. However this variety of grapes is in decline in part due to its' sensitivities to so many different vine ailments (coulure, downy mildew, frost). 


  In recent times, the popularity of the variety has been steadily declining with a 2000 census reporting only 15,000 acres (6,100 hectares) of the vine mostly consigned to the southwestern part of the country. Its stronghold remains Cahors where Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations stipulates that Malbec must compose at least 70% of the blend, with Merlot and Tannat rounding out the remaining percentage. Outside of Cahors, Malbec is still found in small amounts as a permitted variety in the AOCs of Bergerac, Buzet, Côtes de Duras, Côtes du Marmandais, Fronton and Pécharmant. It is also permitted in the Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure (VDQS) of Côtes du Brulhois. In the MIDI region of the Languedoc, it is permitted (but rarely grown) in the AOC regions of Cabardès and Côtes de Malepère. There is a small amount of Malbec grown in the middle Loire Valley and permitted in the AOCs of Anjou, Coteaux du Loir, Touraine and the sparkling wine AOC of Saumur where it is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Gamay. But as elsewhere in France, Malbec is losing acreage other varieties—most notably Cabernet Franc in the Loire.
  
  The grape was historically a major planting in Bordeaux, providing color and fruit to the blend, but in the 20th century started to lose ground to Merlot and Cabernet Franc due, in part, to its sensitivities to so many different vine ailments (coulure, downy mildew, frost). The severe 1956 frost wiped out a significant portion of Malbec vines in Bordeaux, allowing many growers a chance to start anew with different varieties. By 1968 plantings in the Libournais was down to 12,100 acres (4,900 hectares) and fell further to 3,460 acres (1,400 hectares) by 2000. While Malbec has since become a popular component of New World meritages or Bordeaux blends, and it is still a permitted variety in all major wine regions of Bordeaux, its presence in Bordeaux is as a distinctly minor variety. Only the regions of the Côtes-de-Bourg, Blaye and Entre-Deux-Mers have any significant plantings in Bordeaux. - Malbec (Wikipedia).

6986,2,,2017-08-17T14:09:24.643,5,,"Beers (ales and lagers) are broken down into many, many different styles based on how they are brewed. Most beers have only 3 or 4 different types of ingredients. Malt, water, yeast, hops and sometimes fruit or herbs. While there doesn't seem like there can be a lot of variation, there are almost an infinite amount of ways to combine these ingredients. For the specific beers you mention, Brown Ale and Mild Ale are very similar styles. I'm not sure what you mean by ""The Ale"". 

Mild Ale vs. Brown Ale

English-Style Brown Ale
Style Family: Brown Ales
The English-style brown ale ranges from dryer (Northern English) to sweeter (Southern English) maltiness. Roast malt tones (chocolate, nutty) may sometimes contribute to the flavor and aroma profile. Hop bitterness is very low to low, with very little hop flavor and aroma. Known for rich and advanced malt aroma and flavor without centering too much on hops, the English-style mild is extremely sessionable and food-friendly.

English-Style Mild Style Family: Brown Ales
Malt and caramel are part of the flavor and aroma profile of the English-style mild while licorice and roast malt tones may sometimes contribute as well. Hop bitterness is very low to low. U.S. brewers are known to make lighter-colored versions as well as the more common “dark mild.” These beers are very low in alcohol, yet often are still medium-bodied due to increased dextrin malts.

  Stellina is a herbal liqueur made by the monastic order of the Sainte Famille (Holy Family) in Belley, France. It is considered similar to Chartreuse, both being made by monks in the same region, to secret recipes, and also coming in both green and yellow. However, Stellina is much younger (dating to 1904, rather than 1605), smaller (the Sainte Famille order has 300 members), and much less-known than Chartreuse. - Stellina (Wikipedia)


The Order uses the revenues to help the various missions abroad.


  The secrecy is vital, he says, to protect the monastery’s key asset. “We receive a percentage of the sales and use it to help Third World countries. The money doesn’t pay for beautiful cars or houses, it finances our missions in Burkina Faso, the Ivory Coast and Benin, in India and the Philippines, and in Colombia, Brazil and Ecuador.” - This obscure liqueur may save your soul

6992,2,,2017-08-22T11:24:59.767,2,,"Here are some hard alcohol risks.


  Hard Alcohol Risks:
  
  Hard alcohol consumption is contraindicated in certain segments of the population because of the latter’s higher susceptibility to the effects of the beverage. For instance, individuals who have difficulty sleeping, or suffer from depression or other mental disorders, are advised against intake as the psychoactive mechanism of the drink can further worsen said conditions. Consumption is also strongly advised against in pregnant women as it can lead to severe gross motor development, fetal alcohol syndrome, and sudden infant death syndrome, to name a few, in children who got exposed to hard alcohol in the womb. Persons who have to deal with chronic gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome have to steer clear as intake can severely aggravate the conditions as well.
  
  This beverage has a substantial concentration of ethanol per volume as well. Excess ethanol consumption inflicts sever damage to the liver and can bring about scarring or cirrhosis, inflammation or alcoholic hepatitis, and even cancer of said organ. This type of alcohol is associated with other cancers such as those afflicting the mouth and pharynx, the bowels, the breasts, the prostate, and the stomach.
  
  Hard alcohol has a powerful diuretic effect as well. Because this is the case, individuals who have diarrhea, renal problems, or other medical conditions that are prone to severe dehydration must avoid consumption of this drink as well. Such fluid-draining effect of hard alcohol can instigate premature wrinkling of the skin due to dehydration, and may increase the frequency and severity of dermatological allergies like psoriasis and eczema. - Secrets of the Superhuman Food Pyramid: Negative Effects of Hard Alcohol


These are just the tip of the iceberg, for drinking those extremely high levels of alcohol could lead to alcohol poisoning very fast and thus cause unconsciousness or even worse, death.


  Alcohol overdosing is nothing unusual. It’s hard to come across anything beyond 40 percent at bars (unless on demand) because the higher the ABV (alcohol by volume), the higher are your chances of you getting knocked out. But still, there exists a dark land of spirits where ABV can go up to a suicidal 96 percent.
  
  Spirytus Rektyfikowany (96% Alcohol)
  
  The purity of rectified spirit has a practical limit of 95.6% ABV; this hard to pronounce Polish Vodka is a murderous 96% ABV. In short, abusing this drink can literally make you meet God! Spirytus is actually more potent than the widely-known Everclear and sits atop as the world’s strongest alcoholic beverage. -  10 Alcoholic Drinks So Strong They Can Knock Out The Manliest Of You

7002,2,,2017-08-30T12:05:25.253,2,,"Why would you have a “selection of beer for women”?


this is a marketing strategy that aims both women and men.
women like to be treated differently, as a consumer with special needs and expectations.
men looking for a gift to a woman will most likely be attracted by this selection.




From Bridget Brennan, a contributor to Forbes, and head of Female Factor: The often repeated phrase, “I know 50% of my marketing budget is wasted, I just don't know which 50%” – has an answer. It's the 50% that doesn't appeal to women.

She stressed the importance of thinking holistically and practically when working to promote any product to women. Be it color, size, or smell, it's all intended to catch woman's attention.


  Women shop with all their senses.  Is your store a place that people want to linger?  How does it smell, how does it sound?  This creates an opportunity to reach the senses that e-commerce can't.  Women consumers in particular are highly attuned to the details of a retail environment, from scent to lighting to music to the tactile nature of touching and examining products.


From Tom Peters the truth about marketing to women:


  The times they are a-changing. So the situation is as follows:
  Women are the number one business opportunity. They buy lots of stuff. Men and women are very different. Men are (still) in control and are totally, hopelessly, clueless about women. Not enough “stuff” is designed for women or communicated in a way that appeals to women. Most stuff for women is, to be frank, pretty patronising.
  
  This is a straight-down-the-line commercial argument. Women are not a niche market or a minority - they have wallets and, for many businesses, women as decision-makers and consumers hold the key to future success.




Now, is it sexist?

I can't say, but my 2 cents: when targeting women, you're even more willing to add a pink tax.

Eater Miami describes Everything You Need to Eat and Drink at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter by Olee Fowler (May 27, 2016) (emphasis added).


  Non-Alcoholic: Just as the food remains true to the books and the setting, so do the drinks. The real star of the area is the famous Butterbeer and can be found roughly every 20 feet inside both parks. Butterbeer is a butterscotch meets caramel meets cream soda flavored drink. It’s offered in regular form, frozen and even hot for the few days out of the year it drops below 70 degrees.
  
  Almost as popular as the butterbeer is the Pumpkin Juice, which is combination of pineapple and apple juices mixed with pumpkin spice flavoring, and tastes like fall in a cup. Diagon Alley also features the almost neon-bright Fishy Green Ale, which is a mash up of mint and cinnamon with blueberry flavored pearls akin to boba at the bottom. Then there is the twist on lemonade called Tongue Tying Lemon Squash, a fizzy orange concoction known as the Otter’s Fizzy Juice and the Peachtree Fizzing Tea, an unsweetened ice tea.
  
  Alcoholic: But we know what you’re really thinking — what about the booze? Unlike its theme park counterpart Disney World down the street, all Universal parks allow alcohol on-site. Both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley serve two proprietary beers: the dark, malt-heavy porter known as Wizard’s Brew and the lighter lager-style Dragon Scale beer, both created by the Florida Beer Brewing Company.
  
  Adjacent to Three Broomsticks is Hog’s Head Pub is the only bar in the two worlds, which is a bit grim and dark in keeping with the theme of the books. The highlight of the menu is the pub’s own Fire Whiskey, which is its take on cinnamon-flavored Fireball. It also happens to pair well with the Butterbeer. No sodas can be found in Hog’s Head, but there are a few specialty drinks like Hog’s Tea, a Long Island iced tea riff and the strongest drink on the menu, and the Pear Dazzle, which is a mix of vodka and pear cider.

Grapes are grown, generally, in a dry and hot climate. California, Australia, Spain, Italy. Because of this, there are usually less problems with rot and mildew on grape vines. The two biggest problems are powdery mildew and botrytis. There are some insect problems, but generally they are not a big deal. Compared to other crops like lettuce, strawberries, potatoes, the amount of fertilizer and spraying is minimal. 

So, what I am trying to say is that amount of chemicals sprayed on grapevines is already at a low level compared to many other foods you might consume. Here is my controversial take on Organic vs. Traditional wine making. Growers will actually spray MORE chemicals on their grapes they are just ""organic"" just because the Organic chemicals are not as effective. That means more tractors, more people contributing to pollution in and around the vineyard. 

On top of that, in the USA, ""Organic Wine"" is different than in Europe. In Europe, it means that grapes were grown organically. In the USA, it means that they were grown organically AND do not use sulfites. Which the Europeans have known to help preserve wine for thousands of years and are naturally occurring during the fermentation process. (BTW, sulfites are also a nasty chemical in large amounts). There are way more sulfites on your pre-packaged salad and raisins than there are in wine.

REMEMBER, you are consuming a beverage that contains about 14% of a known carcinogen, namely Ethanol. So expecting your drink to have these huge health benefits is kind of a false flag.

You have to ask yourself why there isn't a lot more Organic wine on the market? A fellow grower told me that it doesn't make economical sense. It costs way more money to grow them vs. traditional or just grow Organic grapes and not have to do all the record keeping, which takes a lot of time and money. High quality growers, for the most part are a thoughtful bunch and really don't want to spray non-organic chemicals and winemakers use non-organic chemicals in the winery.

So, here is my recommendation. I really don't think there is a huge environmental or health edge for Organic wine. High volume, low priced wines will generally have more chemicals in them. If you can find an Organic red wine that you like and you can afford, got for it. If you can spend a little more money, say $20 or more for a bottle of wine, those wines probably came from grapes that were babied way more than a box wine grapes and probably have less chemicals in them in general. In fact as you go up the price curve it's generally known they have less and less chemical inputs. So, the more you can spend, the less chemicals will probably be in your wine.

(And to blow your mind, many wines are not vegetarian! And you have no way to find out.)

7031,2,,2017-10-01T14:43:33.373,6,,"The answer to this question is going to differ from person to person, since gout sufferers react differently to both diet and alcohol. For some individuals alcohol increases pain in gout sufferers, while in others it decreases their pain. One has to know how to micro-manage their personal diets and alcohol consumption.


  For those who want to micro-manage their gout diet, you should know that there is never a single best alcoholic beverage. You know that your overall diet needs change at different times in your gout treatment plan. This applies equally to alcohol.  
  
  You should know that the affects of alcohol are different for every gout sufferer. For that reason, I urge you to get a personal gout management plan from your doctor. - What Is The Best Alcoholic Beverage To Drink With Gout?


Gout attacks rise with when your diet is high in purines. Purines are found in high-protein foods, and they are also found in some drinks.


  “Beer contains a large amount of purines and has a strong association with gout attacks. One study estimated that patients who consumed a 12-ounce serving of beer daily were 1.5 times more likely to have gout compared to those without alcohol consumption,” says Dr. Sloane. Beer is especially bad for you if you tend to get gout symptoms because it is high in alcohol and brewer’s yeast, both of which may trigger gout pain.” - Gout and Alcohol


It seems that wine, whiskey or scotch may be a reasonable substitute for beer if drank in moderation or small amounts.


  “In a study published in The Lancet medical journal this spring, researchers followed over 47,000 male medical professionals with no history of gout for up to 12 years. By the end of the study, close to 2 percent of the men had experienced attacks of gout. Men who drank the most alcohol daily had twice the risk of developing the disorder as men who did not drink. Beer drinkers increased their risk by 50% for every daily serving, while those who drank hard liquor increased their risk by 15% for each drink. Men who drank wine did not appear to increase their risk for gout, although few men had more than two glasses of wine daily so these results are less conclusive. - Gout and Alcohol


The Lancet Journal ""interprets"" their findings as such:


  Interpretation
  
  Alcohol intake is strongly associated with an increased risk of gout. This risk varies substantially according to type of alcoholic beverage: beer confers a larger risk than spirits, whereas moderate wine drinking does not increase the risk.


Even though this study is in favor of drinking wine for gout sufferers, all alcohol consumption must be done in moderation and prudence as individuals react differently to alcohol and different types of alcohol.

Some spirits, though, are different. Whiskey made from peated barley retains the smoke flavour of the peat fire, for instance. 

Perhaps the most extreme example, though, is rum. White rum has a sweetness compared to vodka which must come from the sugar base. Darker rums, like most aged spirits, gets the majority of their flavour from the barrel in which they are matured. However, tasting darker rums reveals a lot of sugar product flavours: caramel, fudge and treacle for example. Presumably these also come from the sugar base and not the barrel yet they're a lot stronger in dark rum than in light.

Why is this? What governs the flavours that are left behind after distillation and before maturation? Presumably the temperature at which flavour compounds vaporize is key but are there other factors? Is it different for some spirits than for others - would un-matured whiskey, for example, taste much the same as vodka if not peated?

7042,2,,2017-10-17T18:19:18.883,5,,"I finally did a little digging. The Late Medieval Period is generally considered from 1300-1500. Whisky, did not become wide spread until the 1700s. The first recorded instance of Whisky production was in 1494: 


  The Guild of Barber Surgeons.[15] The earliest Irish mention of whisky comes from the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise, which attributes the death of a chieftain in 1405 to ""taking a surfeit of aqua vitae"" at Christmas.[16] In Scotland, the first evidence of whisky production comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent ""To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae"", enough to make about 500 bottles.


There is ample evidence that liquor distilled from grapes and other fermented fruit well before the 1300's and Brandy was widespread by 1500. Neither Brandy or Whisky was drunk as much as wine or beer during this period, but just from the time line it looks like Brandy was a) easier to make since you start with wine and no cooking involved until distillation b) had a several hundred year head start on Whisky. 

There were distilled beverages in Asia, but again not as widespread as Brandy in Europe.

Just based on the fact that the first mention of Whisky production isn't until 1494, only 6 years before the end of the Late Medieval Period and Brandy production is mentioned many times in The History and Taxonomy of Distilled Spirits before 1500, I think we can safely assume that Brandy was the most widespread distilled beverage in this time frame.

I don't rely on any online knowledge on wines, and am not looking to do so.  That's why I entitled this question using the word ""personal wine notes"".  I also don't wish to rate each wine.  My notes will tell me what I need to know.  Depending on my mood when I review the notes, I may decide to give a wine another try.

What I need is to be able to sort the entries by: (i) date of last try or (ii) alphabetically.  The former lets me see the most recent wines I tried without being hampered by wines that I tried years ago.  The latter lets me look up a specific wine that I may come across, or that someone may have recommended.

Additionally, I would like to access the ""database"" of notes from both my desktop/laptop and my smartphone, and I don't want to go through any cloud service (other than webmail, e.g., gmail).  

The apps that I've read about don't cater to these deceptively simple requirements.  As someone who mashes data in my day job, I can envision a some partial conceptual solutions.  For example, if I had a Microsoft Access database, then each wine can be a single entry in a data table of wines, which links to a table of notes.  The notes table will have a date field and a field for text notes (including cost).  I can then write some code to associate each wine with the date of its most recent note, then sort by either that most recent date or by the wine identification text.

This is fine if I only want to look up the database on the computer, but it does not permit updating on the smartphone.  What works for accessing from phone and computer is to maintain a draft email in my gmail account, which I can access from both the phone and the computer.  But it doesn't allow for the sorting described above.  I've basically entered wines in chronologically.  Sometimes, when someone recommends a wine, it's hard to check whether the wine is deep down in the text file (from years past).

I got tired of that, and took a text mashing editor (vim), made all the entries into one physical line of text, with delimiters separating the different date entries, sorted by wine name, then converted each entry back to the multiline format illustrated above.  Without a database, however, I can't re-sort the wines by date of most recent trial.

Is there a solution that permits the sorting that I want (by wine or by date of most recent trial), accessible for update or lookup from both desktop/laptop and smartphone?  Avoiding the cloud would be preferred.

From Pasteurized Kegged Beer: 


  Non-Pasteurized
  
  For the most part keg beer brewed and packaged in kegs in the U.S. is
  not pasteurized. During the packaging process non-pasteurized draft
  beers are sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving
  bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant. Kegs are kept
  cold ( &lt; 50° F ) from the brewery to the point of dispense. Draft beer
  dispensed from a keg should be fresh by storing as short as possible,
  and serving cold at 38° F.
  
  Temperatures above 38° F may promote non pasteurized draft beers to
  turn sour or cloudy. Should the temperature rise above 50° F, the
  dormant bacteria which ferments and spoils beer will once again become
  active and, subsequent growth will rapidly begin to spoil flavor and
  cloud the beer.
  
  Pasteurized
  
  Most of the keg beer brewed and packaged outside the U.S. (Import
  beers), are heat pasteurized during packaging. This process kills off
  the bacteria that ferment and spoils the beer.
  
  Pasteurized draft beer kegs can be transported and stored at room
  temperature. The beer in these kegs can be flash cooled at the point
  of dispense. However, most imported kegs are stored and dispensed at
  the same temperature (38° F) as domestic, non-pasteurized kegs.

7056,2,,2017-11-02T17:00:25.020,3,,"There are several ways to make a non-alcoholic beer (which BTW is not alcohol free. These beers can have .5% ABV). Boiling off the alcohol at 175f degrees, vacuum distillation at 120f degrees and reverse osmosis filters. They all take a toll on flavor and mouthfeel. 

Here is a great article:


  The most common way that alcohol is removed from beer is through heating. As we've discussed in several previous articles, alcohol has a much lower boiling point than water. At sea level, it's roughly 173 degrees F. 


Then also: 


  To minimize this, some operations practice vacuum distilling. Depending on the power of the vacuum, the alcohol's boiling point may be lowered as far as 120 degrees, which is much less disruptive to the flavors. 


Then the last way:


  ""...beer is passed through a filter with pores so small that only alcohol and water (and a few volatile acids) can pass through. The alcohol is distilled out of the alcohol-water mix using conventional distillation methods, and the water and remaining acids are added back into the syrupy mixture of sugars and flavor compounds left on the other side of the filter. 


The reason why hoppy and dark beers can't really be made this way:


  According to Brew Your Own, ""The hop aromas will usually be driven off within the first five minutes, while the hop flavors will be gone within the first 15 minutes."" This is why neither we nor any of our sources have encountered a half-decent non-alcoholic IPA, which is a damn shame, really.


To sum it up, light lager type beers have little color or flavor to begin with so it's easier for them to come through the process pretty close to what they were before they went in. Hoppy or dark beers would be stripped of so much flavor and color that they would be awful so nobody tries...

7073,2,,2017-11-14T16:01:46.727,6,,"I have pretty extensive experience blending wine in my winery over 15 years. There are two types of blends. Pre-fermentation and post-fermentation. The pre-fermentation is usually called a ""field blend"". This was the old style way of blending wines before we started doing it in the lab. Growers would plant a variety of vines, for example Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in Bordeaux, to hedge their bets on what kind of year it was going to be since they all ripen at different times. They do bring different flavor components to the blend. In Ye Olde days, they would just throw everything in the fermenter together relying on mother nature to give them a good blend.

Today, most blending is done post-fermentation. Very few people do field blends because they want the control over the blend. This is usually done in a laboratory setting. You would ideally want a few beakers with accurate measurements on it. Taste the two individual wines. Then I would start with a 50/50 blend and go from there. If you like more Riesling, then start blending a 60/40 blend of Riesling and Gewurz. Keep doing this until you end up with a blend you like. I usually will create a series of blends and keep them in separate glasses so I can go back and forth smelling and tasting them and keeping notes as I go.

You might dump some wine down the drain to get the blend you want, but once you figure it out, you can go straight to make that blend in the future. I would get an empty wine bottle and put your blend in there. You will have 2-3 days to drink it before it starts to go bad unless you make special effort to preserve it. In theory, you could by X number bottles of Riesling and Y bottles of Gewurz and make a blend of several bottles and rebottle it.

Or, put it another way, if you wanted to showcase a typical range of whiskey styles, could you do it solely with a selection from North America and Scotland, or are there examples made in Ireland of a style unique to that country?

I'm largely ignorant of what goes into the distilling process of both Irish whisky and Scotch, but what I notice as a taster is that Irish whisky is often very sweet, with more like a sugary or fruity taste to it. I'd normally recommend them to people with a sweet-tooth.

Scotch can be very sweet too, but I find the Sherry versions often with more of a butterscotch/caramel flavour, and if they're well produced the sweetness is usually a bit more balanced than in the Irish whiskies I've tried.

If one was a connoisseur I'd imagine they'd be able to differentiate an Irish from a Scottish whisky a majority, but probably not 100%, of the time. But if someone was a beginner they'd most definitely have trouble.

So to answer your question more directly, if you were to showcase whisky, I would argue that you could do so with product coming out of Ireland, but that it would probably be more on par quality wise with American whisky, than it would Scottish.

Vinegar however is created when bacteria that produce acetic acid are present in an environment with a sugar source and oxygen. They will thrive off of the sugar just like brewer's yeast, but will also produce acetic acid as a byproduct of their life processes.

If you wish to make cherry wine, I would suggest diluting the juice down to somewhere in the range of a sugar concentration of 10 percent, measuring with a hydrometer or refractometer, and using a yeast, possibly a dry wine yeast, that can withstand alcohol in ranges of 10-14 percent abv.

With a fractioning column, the answer is: none of the flavour comes from the original fermentation. There is no flavour (sort of....)

Here's what a commercial one looks like:



Or a home use version: 



I'm not very au fait with exactly how a reflux column works, but the end result is a pure flavourless liquid. Roughly the vapours travel up through a long column which contain elements that prevent all but the purest alcohol vapours to pass through.

In the case of Whisky, Rum, Brandy, then yes they do get their flavours from the original fermentation. They are distilled using a pot still (by law in the case of Scotch and Irish whisk(e)ys). This is a much older type of still, less efficient than a column (lower ABV and less yield); key thing is it retains flavor:



Or a home use version:



The nature of a pot still is that it is less efficient than a column, but it allows much more flavor to emerge. 

It is possible to make vodka on a pot still, but great care has to be made to ensure the input alcoholic liquid (the ""wash"") is as clean and neutral as possible, no off flavours from the yeast for example. No commercial distiller would attempt this but some home distillers make do with what they have.

Note that even whisky, which is distilled from dark brown malt ""beer"", will come out of the still as clear as vodka. It derives its final color from the barrel ageing process.

Re the rums, I think techniques vary but I think usually white rum is similar to dark rum but it is carbon filtered after the oak aging process is complete, which removes the colour and also presumably some flavour.

7115,2,,2017-12-13T12:21:47.280,6,,"Right now I can think about some characteristics of a Sotch, that depend partly on the age:


Flavours: The longer a whisky matures in a cask, the stronger is the influence of the cask on the flavours. So the character of a very young whisky largely comes from the distillery. That often means some fresh, fruity flavours, with a significant alcoholic taste. The character of an older whisky is largely defined by the cask(s). That often means some sort of wooden and softer flavours, besides other flavours that depend on the concrete cask.
Color: Assuming the same cask, an 18 years old whisky is always darker than a 12 years old one, because the former had more time to absorb the color from the cask. (Ignoring the fact that many distilleries add caramel colouring before the whisky is bottled)
Alcohol and volume: Over the years, the whisky constantly evaporates through the cask. Therefore, the amount of whisky in the cask is constantly decreasing (that's one reason why old whisky tends to be more expensive than young whisky). As alcohol evaporates easier than water, the alcohol concentration is decreasing as well.


I'm sure that a distillery doesn't use the same distillate for all products. But I have no idea if that means, that the distillate that is designated for an 18 years old whisky is crafted with more care than the one that's designated for a 12 years old whisky. Only differently, I guess.

  Sake (Japanese: 酒, IPA: /ˈsɑːkɛ/ SAH-keh), also spelled saké, (IPA:
  /ˈsɑːkeɪ/ SAH-kay or American English /ˈsɑːki/ SAH-kee)[1][2] also
  referred to as a Japanese rice wine, is made by fermenting rice that
  has been polished to remove the bran. Unlike wine, in which alcohol is
  produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit,
  typically grapes, sake is produced by a brewing process more akin to
  that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars which ferment into
  alcohol.
  
  The brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer in
  that, for beer, the conversion from starch to sugar and from sugar to
  alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. Like other rice wines, when sake
  is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. Furthermore, the
  alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer. Wine generally
  contains 9%–16% ABV,[3] while most beer contains 3%–9%, and undiluted
  sake contains 18%–20% (although this is often lowered to about 15% by
  diluting with water prior to bottling).
  
  In the Japanese language, the word ""sake"" (酒, ""liquor"", also
  pronounced shu) can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage
  called ""sake"" in English is usually termed nihonshu (日本酒, ""Japanese
  liquor""). Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labelled with the word
  seishu (清酒, ""clear liquor""), a synonym less commonly used in
  conversation.

7121,2,,2017-12-15T13:19:22.513,7,,"Short Answer
Sake is categorized as sake, and should not be grouped together with other types of liquor. In Japan, you need a license specifically for making sake, even if you have licenses for making beer, wine and spirits!

Long Answer
To help clarify, let's compare the different liquor types.


  Is sake a spirit?
  No. Sake is brewed. By this definition alone, it disqualifies itself to be classified as a spirit, which are distilled. Shochu (焼酎) would be a closer Japanese counterpart there.
  
  Is sake a wine?
  No. Sake uses a complex fermentation process known as a parallel multiple fermentation, where the rice is converted from start to glucose, then glucose to alcohol simultaneously in the same container. Wine uses the glucose from the grapes, making it a simpler process single fermentation process.
  
  Is sake a beer?
  No. While beer is like sake in the fact that it must first convert starch into glucose, this is done in two separate steps, making it a serial multiple fermentation process. 


By comparing the processes of making the different liquors, we can see that sake does not fall under spirits, wine, or beer. It is somewhere in between wine and beer in terms of process.

Why is it often referred to as a wine?
I do not have the definitive answer, as there is no source that tells me the story behind that. But I can point the similarities between the two liquor types.


  1) Alcohol content is similar.
  A rough average for red and white wines combined is about 13-14%. It's about 15-16% for sake. Spirits like whisky are at 40%, so sake is nowhere near there.
  
  2) They are both highly dependent on ingredients (location).
  For wine, it's the terroir, and for sake, it's the water. This makes the location of both liquors' makers an important factor to the flavors.
  
  3) Taste-wise they are close to each other.
  Especially white wine. Sake can also have sweet, fruity tastes.
  
  4) The way of drinking is similar.
  When you drink a good wine, you let it roll on your tongue a little, try to find the different flavors. The same goes with sake (God forbid you'd just chug it down like a shot of bad tequila!).
  
  5) They way they are sold are similar.
  You don't buy 6-packs of sake, but a large sake bottle, similar to (but usually wider than) wine bottles. There are of course small one-cup sizes, and carton sake (similar to box wine), but the main method of purchase has always been the large bottle.
  
  6) In the US, it's branded as a wine.
  It certainly isn't beer, but if it gets grouped into spirits, sake would be harder to sell in the States, as it would require a separate liquor license to sell it. By counting it as a ""wine"", stores only need a beer/wine license to sell.


In the end, I feel like wine is ""similar enough"" to most people to use as a comparison. I said that sake is sake, but really phrasing it like that doesn't help explain things to people. Having something familiar to compare to makes it easy, though I do wish people didn't stop at ""sake equals wine"", since that isn't an accurate explanation either.

However, the recommended consumption period is usually one year after bottling. After that, the maker cannot guarantee the flavor of the sake. Whatever the flavor of your sake is right now, whether it aged well or went plain ugly, is not the flavor of the sake as advertised by the sake maker. Oh, and if the bottle is open, like wine, sake will oxidize rapidly.

Sake may or may not age well, depending on the sake. I don't have enough knowledge to say what those differences are, though from my experience, old sake can become either a tad acidic or more rich in its original flavor.

You may be able to sell the bottle so someone interested, but I don't think there is a giant market for it outside of Japan (though I may be wrong about that). In Japan, there would be plenty demand for old sake there.

By law, there should be a date on the bottle (not sure if they print that on the box) which indicates the ""month of bottling"". Although, that law may not have existed 50 years back...

Note there is a chance it will go bad in the case it is nama (fresh) sake, which you can tell if you see 生 somewhere on the label. Nama sake is sake that does not undergo the two pasteurization processes after being made, so the yeast is still alive. Taste guarantee is only about a half a year, and something 50 years old will probably taste yogurty or cheesy.

This is done (according to that page) because the grapes have too much sugar and can kill off the yeast and malolactic bacteria.

People have been pressing grapes into wine for thousands of years.  Of course, precise control over the yeast and the process is more modern.

I used to be part of a brewing club that made some of those recipes, and they didn't taste unusual to me.  (Of course, yeast selection might have played a role there.)

What drove the need for dilution?  Is it that the yeasts that are now preferred (or even available) are more fragile?  Are we cultivating grapes with more sugar now?

7149,2,,2018-01-15T17:07:51.237,8,,"There are several factors at play here. If we think about how grapes were maintained hundreds or thousands of years ago, it was kind of a slapdash affair. In the beginning they probably just grabbed whatever grapes they could off a vine growing up a tree. Later they just haphazardly planted grapes in a field hoping for the best and they mixed everything, Red and white grapes and IF they got a harvest they were grateful. This style of grape growing does not lend itself to high sugar grapes. 

This illustration below shows some middle ages grape growing in Burgundy. It's basically a hillside planted every few inches. No trellis or anything. 



Several things changed that equation, especially after WW2. 


New World grape growing. Growing grapes in the new world exploded after WW2 and continues to expand rapidly to this day. Why is this a problem? It is and it isn't. You have to remember grapes like Pinot Noir, Riesling, Cabernet, Grenache were probably grapes that had been domesticated over hundreds or thousands of years to adapt to the climate the original vines were from. Cabernet is a good example. The dreary coast in Bordeaux where the weather is not especially warm. In a good year, the grapes might make a 13% ABV wine. You take Cabernet and stick it in Napa Valley where it is MUCH warmer and sunnier and voila, you have 17% ABV monster cabs. IMHO, it's mostly too hot in Napa Valley to make a balanced wine. Same with much of Australia and South America. 
Modern Viticultural practices. Also after WW2 irrigation was introduced this enabled growers to grow wine in areas that were too dry to grow grapes without it. Washington State is a good example. The Yakima valley gets around 9 inches of rain a year, but the temperatures are within a range of growing grapes, if a little too hot and sunny. Now you have a region that looks nothing like where the grapes originally came from. This also pertains to just about everything about growing grapes today. Trellis systems, fungicides, rootstocks, soil management, canopy management. Everything is done with a high precision to eke out the most of the vines, resulting in wines that are super ripe.
Modern Tastes - As our palates seek out more and more sweet things, many of these modern wines are made with higher alcohols on purpose because many times high octane wines come with a fair amount of residual sugar.
Because we can! In the new world we don't have the baggage that they do in Europe. We are allowed to pretty much do anything to our wines as long as it's legal and food grade. So, if you grapes accidentally got a few extra days in 100+ degree weather and started to turn to raisins and they are at 29 brix. You paid good money for those grapes and you can't waste them so you dump some acidulated water into your fermenter to water them down to acceptable levels and replace some acid that was lost because your grapes are over ripe. All perfectly legal in the New World, but absolutely verbotten in Europe. 
Brand name grapes - Everyone wants Cabernet and Chardonnay. Sure you can grow them in the Central Valley in California where it is super hot in the summer, but what type of wine do you get? Hardly recognizable from the original areas they came from, but the consumers just want to have these brand name grapes so we plant them in places of abundant heat having to water them down in the fermenter to make acceptable wines. 


I remember my viticulture teacher telling me that you should plant grapes that would ripen almost at the last possible day of the season. This would result in grapes that are in harmony with the local climate. What you see in many places like California where grapes are harvested in July and August and there is still MONTHS of hot weather ahead. 

All of this leads to a situation where many of the grapes we plant in the new world are simply not in the best climate for the best wine. 99% of the time it's grapes planted in a climate that's simply too hot. That's why we water our wines down.

7153,2,,2018-01-17T16:50:44.987,8,,"Some people have made the claim that drinking through a straw will get you more drunk than drinking without one. This seems to be a Myth.


  Many people have claimed that drinking alcohol through a straw gets you drunk faster than drinking it regularly. 
  
  Proponents of the Straw theory have two primary claims.  First, when drinking through a straw, people usually drink faster than if they were drinking regularly. Because they are ingesting more alcohol in a shorter period of time, they will clearly get more drunk faster.  Secondly, a straw creates a vacuum, which eliminates oxygen. The feeling of intoxication is created in part, because of the lack of oxygen entering us, so when we form a vacuum with a straw, we should naturally get more drunk. Additionally, by creating a vacuum with the straw, the boiling point of alcohol falls, and alcohol vapors are created within the straw, then inhaled into the lungs. This gets the alcohol into the bloodstream much faster than normal ingestion via the stomach.
  
  However, many opponents of the straw method say that although this science is true, the difference would be so negligible it wouldn't even be noticeable.  The New York Times even went a step further in ts Q&amp;A section, writing that ""There is no evidence that people get drunk faster if they drink alcoholic beverages through a straw, according to the National Institute on Alcoholic Abuse.""  And even the folks at Mythbusters weighed in on the topic, when it was posted in the community forums of their website, claiming that it was ""Busted."" - Do you get Drunk Faster with a Straw?

7154,2,,2018-01-19T15:28:04.830,5,,"There is the usual great stuff relating to 'Toasting'. From wikipedia - which is normally correct.

I then had a quick look at snopes.com, they proclaim the following to be false:


  Q: Why do people clink their glasses before drinking a toast?
  A: It used to be common for someone to try to kill an enemy by offering him a poisoned drink. To prove to a guest that a drink was safe, it became customary for a guest to pour a small amount of his drink into the glass of the host. Both men would drink it simultaneously. When a guest trusted his host, he would then just touch or clink the host’s glass with his own.


ORIGINS:   Many explanations have been advanced to explain our custom of clinking glasses when participating in toasts. One is that early Europeans felt the sound helped to drive off evil spirits. Another holds that by clanking the glasses into one another, wine could be sloshed from glass to glass, thereby serving as a

Wine glasses

proof the beverages had not been poisoned. Yet another claim asserts that the “clink” served as a
symbolic acknowledgment of trust among imbibers who did not feel the need to sample each others’ drinks to prove them unadulterated.

Each of those explanations is false. While making a racket for the purpose of scaring off evil spirits underpins other customs that carry over to this day (e.g., the tolling of church bells at weddings, and the loud shouts and noisemaking at the stroke of twelve on New Year’s Eve), the “clink” is a relatively new aspect of toasting and, as such, came along well after folks had relinquished the notion that demons both lurked in every corner of typical day-to-day existence and could be sped on their way by a bit of noise. As for sloshing wine from one glass to another, drinking vessels would need to be filled to the brim to effect that, and if they were, such practice would waste valuable potables (because some would be sure to land on the floor) and likely douse the toasters too. And while the poisoning of enemies has long been part of the ordinary mayhem of the world, the practice of touching of one’s filled glass to those of others when participating in a toast is unrelated to suspicion of the wine’s having been tampered with; such killings were not so common at any nebulous point in the past that a signal to one’s host indicating he was clear of suspicion of attempted murder needed to be enshrined in the canon of social gestures.

To get at the real reason for the clink of glass on glass, we have to first look at why and how we toast, and where the practice originated.

The custom of sealing with booze expressions of good wishes for the health of others dates back so far that its origins are now lost to us, yet in numerous cultures

such acts of camaraderie often involved shared drinking vessels. The clinking of individual cups or glasses as a proof of trust wouldn’t have meant much when
everyone drank from the same bowl. Indeed, in those cultures where shared drinking containers was the norm, to produce one’s own vessel in such company was to communicate an unmistakable message of hostility and distrust; it would have been regarded as akin to bringing along a food taster to sample the repast.

“Toasting,” our term for the pronouncement of benedictions followed by a swallowing of alcohol, is believed to have taken its name from a practice involving a shared drinking vessel. Floated in the “loving cup” passed among celebrants in Britain was a piece of (spiced) cooked bread that the host would consume along with the last few drops of liquid after the cup had made one round of the company. In modern times toasting has become a matter of imbibing from individual drinking vessels rather than from one shared flagon, so to compensate for the sense of unity lost in doing away with the sharing of the same cup we have evolved the practice of simultaneously drinking each from our own glass when a toast is made, thereby maintaining a communal connection to the kind words being spoken.

The clinking of glasses has been added to the practice of offering toasts for a few reasons, none having anything to do with poison. Prior to such augmentation, toasts pleased only four of the five senses; by adding the “clink,” a pleasant sound was made part of the experience, and wine glasses have come to be prized not only for their appearance but also for the tones they produce when struck. Yet beyond mere aural pleasure, the act of touching your glass to that of others is a way of emphasizing that you are part of the good wishes being expressed, that you are making a physical connection to the toast. The practice also serves another purpose, that of uniting the individuals taking part in the benediction into a cohesive group: as the wine glasses are brought together, so symbolically are the people holding them. On a deeper level, the wine is also being recommuned with itself — that which had been one (when it had been in its own bottle) but was separated (when it was poured into a variety of glasses) is brought back into contact with the whole of itself, if only for a moment.

Etiquette mavens say one need not clink glasses with everyone present when participating in toasts among large assemblies. Rather than reach across vast expanses of wide tables (thereby risking losing your balance and ending up in the guacamole), simply raise your glass and make eye contact with the group.

MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT

So, with all this in mind, my own thought is that in times gone by as 'rivals' drank each others health, they would drink from the other person's cup (to avoid poisoning - however all one would have to do would be to poison one's own cup - surely that would have worked?!), as the cups were held to the other person's lips they would inadvertantly 'clink' together.  As time moved on and we attempted not to kill everyone in our paths the clinking just wort of became symbolic.

That is very different to the Scotch whisky usually recommended in whisky cocktails, which require more of a bitter/tart edge than the sweetness of Jack Daniels.

For any whisky cocktail I personally would use a decent single malt Scotch whisky to get the best taste for me, but everyone's palate is different. I only use Jack Daniels in sweet cocktails, or with cola.

Port is made by stopping fermentation with alcohol leaving behind some unfermented grape juice and about 20% alcohol. Because of the high alcohol, properly stored Port rarely has the problems that regular wine have. Actually, part of the reason they started putting alcohol in wine like this was exactly for abuse. It was meant to ship all over the world in adverse conditions and still be drinkable. 

Enjoy your Port now or hold for as long as can. Maybe up to another 20 years!

Once the yeast has settled and your wine or cider looks clear, you then place it in a freezer and watch for ice to form in the neck first. Once the yeast sediment freezes in the neck only, remove it from the freezer and open the bottle and the frozen yeast can be easily removed.

Vintage champagne, whilst not to everyone’s tastes, is usually only created when harvests are at their best.  Furthermore the grapes must be aged in a bottle for longer (a minimum of three times longer if memory serves) before release. This should be at least 18 months so the flavour develops.  Finally the taste develops in the bottle, just some reasons but it wasn’t designed to be drank in 1979.

As others have said a lot of people don’t often realise that vintage champagne is flat, the carbonation doesn’t last forever. The taste you are experiencing sounds right though and it is safe as long as it’s been sealed for it’s life etc.

Hope that makes sense, hope it tastes nice!

Basically, many wines (Greece, France, Italy...) were kind of ""sour"" and people were used to adding spices (among other things), not only to ""sweeten"" the taste, but also to help store the wine and keep it drinkable for a longer time. (1)

Some of the wines the Romans used to drink (there may be more than that, of course):


Mulsum -> wine with spices and honey (served during the gustatio, before the meal)
Turriculae -> dry wine, with sea-water, fenugreek and defrutum (2).
Carenum ->  sweet and liquorous, from very mature / ripe grapes, with quince, various plants and defrutum.
Vinum picatum -> (pitched wine is the closest I can come with in English) wine that was sweetened by the pitch used to seal the container.



  Why would they add many different plants / herbs / honey / water?


Ref. Wikipedia : Romans drank their wine mixed with water, or in ""mixed drinks"" with flavorings. Mulsum was a mulled sweet wine, and apsinthium was a wormwood-flavored forerunner of absinthe. Although wine was enjoyed regularly, and the Augustan poet Horace coined the expression ""truth in wine"" (in vino veritas), drunkenness was disparaged. It was a Roman stereotype that Gauls had an excessive love of wine, and drinking wine ""straight"" (purum or merum = unmixed) was a mark of the ""barbarian"".

It seems that it was done for 3 purposes:


keep wine longer and help it come from countries hundreds of miles and days of travel away.
make the wine more ""drinkable"" and enjoyable.
don't do like barbarians do and look like a well-educated person.


-> How alcoholic was it? is a question I have no knowledge of and no answer to.



1 - FWIW: adding spices to a beverage was done again centuries later, when people started drinking hot chocolate (before the refining process / conche was discovered). The taste was so bitter / sour that people put a lot of spices and sugar in it.

2 - A reduction of must in Ancient Roman cuisine, made by boiling down grape juice or must in large kettles until reduced to half of the original volume. See also grape syrup.

I suppose if you want to use a big propane burner for boiling the wort you might need to check if such things are permitted at your property.  If they don't allow BBQs you probably couldn't use that type of burner.  If you've got the time you should be able to do it on most stove tops though.  And more time to brew means more time to enjoy previously brewed after all!

For the fermentation, ideally you'll want a dark place that's reasonably temperature controlled, but if your apartment has its temps in a reasonable range you could probably make it work without a special fermentation chamber--which you could also likely buy or make if you care enough to.

Red wine needs air after being opened and is therefore often filled into a decanter. When you do this carefully the sediments remain in the bottle.

In general the sediments are not hazardous to your health. The tartar can even be a symptom of good quality.

When you store wine you should lay bottles in horizontal and keep the label upside. After opening the bottle you should empty it carefully with label up. So everybody can read the label and the sediments will remain in the bottle to keep the wine in glasses clear.

However, in the longer past not all bottles were really carefully cleaned. The result was a wine with a terrible taste, not even vinegar. You can be sure that since decades wine makers take care to have bottles clean, if they want to remain in business.

The short answer is yes.

Here is a nice read. 


  I brewed my first batch of beer in my tiny Syracuse apartment while the snow piled up outside. 
  
  Some people are turned off by the idea of small-batch brewing (one to two gallon batches) because they like to produce beer in larger volumes (five to ten gallon batches), and that’s okay—I like beer as much as the next guy, and having a large supply of it is (almost) never a bad thing. There's also a lot of comfort in that many of the homebrewing recipes and kits available cater to the familiar 5-gallon scale. However, there are a number of distinct advantages to small-batch brewing—especially for people living in small spaces—that I’ve come to realize over the years. In this post, I’ll share a few of them.
  
  
  Your Significant Other Won't Lose a Closet
  
  
  A 5-gallon batch of beer will fill about 50 12-ounce bottles. That’s a lot of beer to store in your living space—even if you are drinking a few a day. And don't forget the pair of 5-gallon buckets you'll need to stash somewhere. At the 1-gallon scale, a single batch of home brew can fit in your fridge (easy access!), and your equipment can sit right on your countertop. Sourcing and storing ingredients is a breeze as well, as most 1-gallon recipes use between 2 and 3 pounds of grain, significantly less than their 5-gallon counterparts. Trust me, your significant other will thank you for the extra space!
  
  
  
  Brew storage in a closet
  
  
  The Cost to Produce Won't Break the Bank
  
  
  Of course, there’s something to be said for the economies of scale you can experience when buying ingredients in bulk. But as mentioned above, urban dwellers don’t always have the luxury of extra space. And when making only one to two gallon batches, picking up everything you need at the homebrewing supply store won’t break the bank. If you have a favorite recipe, you can scale it down proportionately.
  
  
  You'll Avoid Some of the Risk
  
  
  For any homebrewer who’s learned a lesson in sanitation the hard way or woke up in the middle of the night to a symphony of bottle bombs exploding, you know it’s a total bummer. But as you scale down the cost of your brew, a bad batch poses less risk to your bottom line. This can be especially beneficial if you’re brewing with some expensive ingredients.
  
  
  You'll Brew More Often and Learn Faster
  
  
  For most homebrewers, it doesn’t always make sense to brew a five or ten gallon batch every two weeks, especially when a brew can consume the better part of a day. But with small batch brewing if you've got the funds, it's pretty easy to routinely pump out a gallon or two at a time. A shorter process means you're likely to brew more often. Home brewing is so much of a learning-by-doing hobby, that this type of iterative process can elevate your skills at a much faster rate. Testing out variations on the same recipe between small batches is a great way to perfect your beer!
  
  
  A Hot Plate Could Provide the Heat You Need
  
  
  Brewing a five or ten gallon batch requires a lot of water and considerable heat to achieve the right boil. This is why you might have seen some ""homebrewing porn"" pictures with an awesome garage setup that includes propane burners. We love those, but that's not practical in a small apartment, especially if you're limited to an ""apartment-sized"" appliance. With small batch brewing, you can brew quickly and easily with as little as a hot plate.
  
  
  You Can Clock a Brew In Two Hours Or Less
  
  
  Just about anyone who's brewed a 5+ gallon batch of beer has spent a long night patiently waiting for water to boil, and after brewing, waiting for the beer to cool to the proper temperature. Although those can be among the most rewarding nights for some, a quicker process is a great bonus for most small-batch brewers, and helps us squeeze in an evening of brewing beer even during a busy week. With a brewing process which can clock in at under two hours from start to finish, brewing small has convenience on its side. You'll need little more than a stirring spoon and your arm to craft a tasty batch of beer. In contrast, the logistical ""bigness"" of a 10-gallon batch can be a big turnoff for some—lugging hefty pots of water and grain hither and yon is a daunting task. 
  
  
  It's a Perfect Recipe For Experimentation
  
  
  The size of your batch does not have to limit the amount of creativity you put into each one. However, the frequency, cost and required storage can absolutely be limiting factors. Brewing small means you're free to experiment with a variety of styles and recipes without going ""all-in."" With such a quick turnover between batches, you can always keep your fridge stocked with new and interesting choices. Suddenly you can lager your beer without a dedicated fridge, or test out some new and different ingredients you've had your eye on. Oyster stout, anyone?
  
  
  Cleaning Up Is a Cinch
  
  
  With larger batch brewing, you can easily generate 15 to 30 pounds of wet grain. Managing that waste is a challenge for home brewers living in a city apartment--especially when taking out the trash is already a hassle. Wouldn't you rather deal with 3-5 pounds of waste instead? Better yet, with even a little culinary flair, you can turn your spent grain into all manner of delectable treats!
  
  
  You're Less Likely to Burn Something
  
  
  Not that you hear about too many homebrewing-related house fires or injuries, it's worth mentioning that brewing in smaller batches gives you a bit more control over what's happening. Coupled with the fact that it's a shorter process, better control more often than not results in a safer brew. Handling big volumes of heated water can result in burns, and over time, large 5-gallon glass carboys can weaken and be quite dangerous when they shatter—not to mention the loss of an entire batch of beer. - 9 Reasons Urban Dwellers Should Consider Small-Batch Brewing

7235,2,,2018-04-09T21:42:41.000,1,,"There is a number of alcohol reduced wines in the market. I avoid saying ""alcohol-free"" because there is no ""alcohol-free wine"". Most still have less than 0.5 percent of alcohol.

First of all: The production of alcohol reduced wine starts in the same way as any other wine as well with fermentation and production of alcohol. But wine without alcohol will never have the same taste as normal wine.

As production will always start with wine containing alcohol, it must be reduced or eliminated afterwards. However the process of alcohol extraction has a significant influence to the taste.


Warm Distillation destroys a lot of taste components (flavours). So it is the worst method.
Cold distillation in change is considered to be the best method, because it uses vacuum and alcohol evaporates around 27°C (80 °F), while other flavours retain in the liquid.
Using a specific membrane is a process like reverse osmosis, separating here the alcohol.
Thin film evaporation is a warm technology which also eliminates flavours.


All processes have an influence to the taste, while cold distillation is considered to have the lowest impact to other components and flavours. Almost all producers intend to compensate these effects by adding flavours, but finally, as long as there are no other methods developed to create ""alcohol-free wine"" an alcohol reduced wine will never have the same taste.

  What is non-alcoholic wine?
  
  It's  pretty much what it says on the can, (or the bottle in this case). It’s wine with the alcohol removed. However, some of the beverages can still contain some alcohol, because let’s face it, it’s pretty hard to extract every single bit. Under the law, in order to be called ‘non-alcoholic’, a beverage can contain up to half a per cent of alcohol by volume. It can be a bit confusing, so here’s a quick guide to non-alcoholic wines and their labels in the UK:
  
  
  Non-alcoholic: contains no alcohol at all (0.0%)
  Alcohol-free: contains 0.05% alcohol or less
  De-alcoholized: contains 0.5% alcohol or less
  Low-alcohol: contains more than 0.5% but no more than 1.2%

For the 1920s: Dom Pérignon logo champagnes

Dom Pérignon  Brut Champagne 1982

For this decade I would like to propose any French champagne that puts Dom Pérignon into the spotlight on the label. 


  Champagne Region
  
  Sources estimate that approximately 300 million bottles of champagne were sold in the year of 2015. All this champagne is made from grapes grown in a distinctive part of France, the Champagne region. This region of small 34.000 hectares received the sole right to the champagne brand once the law of 1927 was passed. The law of 1927 defined the champagne production zone and defined restrictions when making champagne. The champagne production is located just 150 kilometers east of Paris and is divided into four geographical areas.
  
  
  Marne (66% of planted area)
  Aube (23%)
  Aisne (10%)
  Haute-Marne and Seine-et-Marne.
  
  
  Together these areas form the Champagne region. The reason why the champagne region has been declared the only place in the world to make champagne, is due to the geographical location concerning the latitude and the changing climate, being both influenced by the continental climate as well as the oceanic climate. 


For the 1930s: Pol Roger 


  Hitler Couldn't Defeat Churchill, But Champagne Nearly Did
  
  During the 1930s, as Adolf Hitler was rising to power in Germany, the man who would turn out to be his most implacable foe was drowning — in debt and champagne.
  
  In 1936, Winston Churchill owed his wine merchant the equivalent of $75,000 in today's money. He was also in hock to his shirt-maker, watchmaker and printer — but his sybaritic lifestyle, of a cigar-smoking, horse-owning country aristocrat, continued apace.
  
  To get an idea of Churchill's annual alcohol consumption, here's what he ordered in 1908, the year he married Clementine:
  
  Nine-dozen bottles and seven-dozen half-bottles of Pol Roger 1895 vintage champagne, plus four-dozen half-bottles of the 1900 Pol Roger vintage.
  
  Churchill drank several brands of champagne such as Giesler, Moet et Chandon, and Pommery, but Pol Roger was his clear favorite. Every year on Churchill's birthday, the charming and shrewd Odette Pol Roger sent him a case of champagne. (His other great friend, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, sent him caviar — until they fell out over Churchill's Iron Curtain speech.)




For the 1940s: Moët


  Occupation Begins, Summer 1940
  
  In the first weeks of the occupation, more than 2 million bottles of wine were stolen by Germans. It was comparable to full scale looting of the sort seen after natural disasters and coups, but in this case it involved some of the most storied vineyards in the world and Moët suffered more than most.
  
  “The Chandon château on the grounds of Dom Pérignon’s abbey had been burned down and many other buildings  belonging to Moët were taken over to house German troops. To add insult to injury, the company had also been ordered to supply the Third Reich with 50,000 bottles of champagne a week, or about one-tenth of all the champagne the Germans were requisitioning.”


For the 1950s:Piper-Heidsieck


  The champagne brand of choice for Marilyn Monroe, Marie Antoinette and all the stars at the Oscars, Piper-Heidsieck champagne is one of the most iconic luxury brands and a favourite among fashion and luxury lifestyle brands. So no wonder it's still doing rather well today - after all, how many brands can say that Marie Antoinette was their first brand ambassador? 


And there is more:


  In a similarly extravagant vein, Marilyn Monroe was reputed to have taken a bath in 350 bottles of Champagne. - Champagne glass


There is even a Marilyn Monroe Champagne Cocktail Recipe.

Going to put the Mumm champagne for this decade. Some may say something else, but I like the Mumm champage in coupe glasses.

  No matter who inspired the coupe glass, it's safe to say its infamy keeps it popular to this day.

With TV shows like ""Mad Men"" and ""Boardwalk Empire,"" old-fashioned drinks and drinking glasses have been making a comeback.

Mumm’s French Champagne (1968)

For the 1970s: Bollinger 


  Bollinger champagnes have appeared in 14 James Bond films, dating back to 1973's ""Live and Let Die.""


For the 1980s: Dom Perignon


  Dom Pérignon was served at the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in 1981. A special insignia just for this event was put on the bottles of the 1961 vintage that was served.


For the 1990s: Crystal


  Since the late 1990s, high-end champagne brands have been featured in rap and hip hop music and videos; bottles featured in videos are often quite blingy and distinctive, often gold. The Louis Roederer brand Cristal, with a gold label, has seen increased popularity since the mid-to-late 1990s due to its association with rap and hip hop artists, notably the New York rappers Biggie Smalls (the Notorious B.I.G.), Puff Daddy, and Jay-Z. This high-end image has been cultivated and managed by Cristal's US importer, Maisons Marques. Since 2006, Cristal has seen a loss of popularity and some boycotts, notably by Jay-Z, due to statements perceived as racist, with other champagnes such as Armand de Brignac (gold bottle) making inroads. - Champagne in popular culture


For the 2000s: Dom Pérignon and Dom Pérignon Rosé


  No New Year's Eve would be complete without welcoming the new year (and bidding an enthusiastic farewell to the prior year) with a bottle of bubbly. It's the stuff of celebrations and special occasions, and it's such a big part of holiday traditions around the world that about 25 percent of all champagne is sold in the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve. Just what is it that makes champagne the perfect New Year's drink? You might be surprised.
  
  Champagne became the drink of choice at a huge number of landmark celebrations, from royal weddings to the scaling of some of the world's toughest mountains. It then also became linked with New Year's celebrations, which started first with Julius Caesar. It wasn't until the 1800s that staying up for a midnight party became a common tradition, and we know champagne was a major part of it from at least mid-century.


January 1st, 2000 ushered in the New Millennium and drinking champagne is such an iconic symbol for celebrating this event or any other celebration or party as Dom Pérignon  and Dom Pérignon Rosé should be a part of it.


  Dom Pérignon’s vintage-only champagne has earned unquestionable prestige and iconic status for its ability to evolve while “resting on the lees”—this lets the champagne develop better textures and flavours, so the next batch of the same vintage is even more intense. These privileged points in time have been dubbed “plenitudes”, and in the case of its P2 2000—the second plenitude of its vintage 2000—can take as long as 16 years to show.
  
  Geoffroy mentions that the wine he is working on now will only be released in around 10 years, and the second plenitude, 15 to 20 years after that. Hence, he reminds us that ripeness is key to a good vintage. In fact, the extreme ripeness of the vintage 2003 harvest, which he describes as “insane and out of balance”, was too much for many but not Dom Pérignon, which saw opportunity in the challenge and eventually declared it a vintage year. “It was the mother of all hot vintages,” he exclaims. - We Taste Dom Pérignon’s P2 2000 Champagne In Beijing With Alain Ducasse





  The 2004 vintage of Dom Perignon is worth the treat and is a Champagne apart from the rest with notes of marzipan and dry cocoa powder and racy minerality. The toasty finish on the palate is pleasantly unexpected. It is a really well-rounded Champagne with even darker notes on the finish with a kick of spice. 
  
  There’s no better way to ring in the New Year, than with a glass of Dom Preignon. - Dom Perignon 2004


For the 2010s: Juglar, Veuve Clicquot and Heidsieck Champagnes (until this decade is over)

The decade is not over, so let us wait a few years to truly answer this one. In the meantime I place these three champagnes temporarily as an honorary iconic examples of a champagne that is well made and bottled as preservation in obscure and precarious situations shows!


  In the summer of 2010 five bottles of beer were discovered in a shipwreck in Föglö in Åland’s outer archipelago. The wreck contained 145 bottles of champagne and five bottles of beer from the 1840s.
  
  Owing to the constant temperature between four and six degrees, the dark surroundings, the pressure inside the bottles and the pressure at the bottom of the sea, the champagne was in extremely good condition. Each bottle was uncorked, tasted and classified by international expert Richard Juhlin.
  
  Out of the bottles that were salvaged, 95 were from the Juglar champagne house, which closed down in 1829. The same owners produce Jacquesson today. Veuve Clicquot was represented by 46 bottles and Heidsieck &amp; Co by four. The Veuve Clicquot bottles were dated 1841–1850. - The oldest champagne found at the bottom of the sea

Given that it was a commercial wine I don't there was much live, viable yeast in the bottle. Particularly if sulfites were added, triggering additional fermentation would probably be difficult.

On top of that, refrigerating it for the whole 24 hours means that, even if there was viable yeast uninhibited by sulfites, it's very unlikely it much fermentation could occur. It's possible you could see some fermentation due to the Crabtree effect but it wouldn't have been much.

The alcohol already in the wine is a barrier for the yeast to re-ferment.
The sulfites in the wine could inhibit refermentation if it hasn't dissipated yet. 
The cold temperatures that will also inhibit fermentation. 
Many commercial wines are sterile filtered so yeast counts are zero to very, very tiny. 


So, in 24 hours it's highly unlikely that it fermented again. Your perception of alcohol may be enhanced by the sugar that you added. High alcohol wines routinely taste ""sweeter"" to many people even though sugar levels are low. You might have tricked yourself into thinking sweet wine = higher alcohol.

Thus for the example with alcohol prohibition in the 1920's US, crime families immediately started to acquire or make product, distribute it, and even open facilities to sell and consume.

The short answer is no.

But that said, there are some spirits that some might want to think twice about since they have an overpowering taste. On the top of my list would be absinthe and chartreuse (especially the green). 


  Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as ""la fée verte"" (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed. - Absinthe (Wikipedia)
  
  Chartreuse has a very strong characteristic taste. It is very sweet, but becomes both spicy and pungent. It is comparable to other herbal liqueurs such as Galliano, Liquore Strega or Kräuterlikör, though it is distinctively more vegetal. Like other liqueurs, its flavour is sensitive to serving temperature. If straight, it can be served very cold, but is often served at room temperature. It is also featured in some cocktails. Some mixed drink recipes call for only a few drops of Chartreuse due to the assertive flavour. It is popular in French ski resorts where it is mixed with hot chocolate and called Green Chaud. - Chartreuse (Wikipedia)


Personally I drink chartreuse and bénédictine straight, while I will drink absinthe with water and ice. Absinthe is too overpowering for me to use in a cocktail or mix.

In the end, whether or not to use a particular spirit in a cocktail or as a mix is personal choice and there are no fixed rules on the subject, so one must be aware of what a particular spirit might do to your recipe.

The salt in the ice water will in turn lower the freezing temperature of the water slightly, ensuring it is as cold as possible, and the conduction cooling of the water against the cans or bottles will cool them much more rapidly than exposing them primarily to cold air, as they would be either in a freezer or in ice alone.

One possible problem is that the internal temperature of a typical home fridge or freezer isn't very consistent. The bottles in the bottom back may freeze while the ones in the top front are too warm. A small fan, like the muffin fans they sell for electronics, will move the air around inside enough to keep it consistent, and they cost less than $20.

Temperature: around 12-13 C (55 F)
Humidity: around 70 percent
Light: keep wines out of sunlight or even bright lights


And if the bottles have cork stoppers, they need to be stored on their side to prevent the cork drying out. This isn't an issue with screw tops.

And that's pretty much it. If you don't have a cooler or cellar, keeping them in a cool, dark cupboard is still going to help...

First of all, not all wines are meant to be aged. The vast majority of wines are meant to consume when you pick them up at the store. How can you tell which are which? Mainly on price (although not always the case). As the price point goes higher, these wines have been made with aging in mind and many times are unpalatable at a younger age. Red wines are meant to age longer because the tannins (the thing that gives red wine it's color) are an anti-oxidant. Some white wines like Riesling can age for decades. Champagnes can age for a long time, but because of their delicate nature and the cork and the whole CO2 pressure thing, they are harder to age. I've had some nicely aged Champagnes. 

So basically, keep it in the dark and as close to freezing as possible. Some say that 55F is the best temperature, but actually the closer to freezing you get makes it keep longer. The problem is that for bottles with corks you should have a relatively high humidity so the corks don't dry out. 

The myth that wines with screw caps don't age has been debunked by the Australian wine industry because the have mostly moved to screw caps and the wines age just fine if differently than bottles with corks.

Aging of Wine from Wikipedia pretty much tells you the whole story.

If you're fermenting grains, it's beer.

If you're fermenting fruits, it's wine.

If you're fermenting honey, it's mead.

It's not really that simple, because there are beers that use fruit (e.g., cherry lambic, raspberry wheat), beers that use honey (it's a fairly common adjunct), wines that use fruit (e.g., elderberry wine), and a whole lot of meads that use fruit. The crossover is substantial. When you consider hard ciders, it gets even more complicated (is apple wine really a cider?).

The base ingredient of beer is almost always malted barley. Even beers named for another grain — like wheat beer, oatmeal stout, rye beer — use malted barley as a base. Hops are a critical ingredient in beer for two reasons: bittering and aroma.

The base ingredient of mead is always honey. I've had mead with hops (Charm City makes one), but it's uncommon, and I personally don't like the flavor.

It's more common to find a winery that makes mead than a brewery that makes mead. There's an outstanding one in Montana called Hidden Legend. They also make a mead/wine blend called a ""pyment,"" which was popular in the 15th century or so.

Of Course mulled wine is a very popular tradition on this day and throughout the Christmas season.

St. John the Apostle, is the disciple &quot;whom Jesus loved&quot;. It is a custom in the old countries to drink of &quot;St. John's Love&quot;. The Church provided a special blessing of wine in honour of the Saint. According to legend St. John drank a glass of poisoned wine without suffering harm because he had blessed it before he drank. The wine is also a symbol of the great love of Christ that filled St. John's heart with loyalty, courage and enthusiasm for his Master; he alone of all the apostles was not afraid to stay close to Our Lord during the Passion and Crucifixion. - St. John's Wine

Nowadays the faithful drink mulled wine (Glühwein) on the Feast of St. John. Many different cultures still take part in this tradition.

This hot mulled wine can be served on St. John's feast day. On St. John's Day, the Roman Ritual tells us that &quot;wine offered by the faithful is blessed in remembrance and in honour of St. John who without any ill effects drank a cup of poisoned wine.&quot; It was by faith that St. John was saved, and through the mystical union became the disciple whom the Lord loved best. By love and faith man comes to God. We, too, pray as members of the mystical body. - St. John's Wine

Then there is the Nordic Glögg mulled wine tradition which is served on St. Lucy's Day (December 13) in Sweden.

Glögg, gløgg, glögi and similar words are the terms used for mulled wine in the Nordic countries.
In Sweden, ginger bread and lussebullar (also called lussekatter), a type of sweet bun with saffron and raisins, are typically served on December 13 to celebrate Saint Lucia's Day. It is also traditionally served at the julbord, the Christmas version of the classic, Swedish buffet smörgåsbord. In Denmark, gløgg pairings typically include æbleskiver sprinkled with powdered sugar and accompanied with strawberry marmalade. In Norway, gløgg is paired with rice pudding (Norwegian: riskrem). In such cases, the word graut-/grøtfest is more precise, taking the name from the rice pudding which is served as a course. Typically, gløgg is drunk before eating the rice pudding, which is often served with cold, red cordial (saus). - Mulled Wine (Wikipedia)

Many European countries including Germany celebrate Silvesterabend (New Yerar's Eve) with mulled wine.

Austria, and its neighbour to the north, Germany, call New Year's Eve Silvesterabend, or the eve of Saint Sylvester. Austrian revelers drink a red wine punch with cinnamon and spices, eat suckling pig for dinner and decorate the table with little pigs made of marzipan, called Marzipanschwein. New Year's food traditions around the world
The last day of the year is called &quot;Sylvester&quot; in Europe. This word is derived from the liturgical feast, celebrated on December 31, of St. Sylvester, pope and confessor, who died in the fourth century.
The end of the old and the beginning of the new year was, and still is, observed with popular devotional exercises. Special services are held in many churches on New Year's Eve to thank God for all His favours in the past year and to implore His blessings for the new one.
A distinctive feature of the traditional celebration is the feasting and merrymaking during the night, often combined with masquerades, singing, and noisemaking. This is a relic of the pre-Christian reveling in ancient Rome; its original significance was to salute the New Year and to drive the demons away.
The main item of Sylvester drinking is the punch bowl. Today we have quite a variety of punches. The modern form of punch originated in England in the early seventeenth century. It consists of alcohol, water, spice, sugar, fruit essence. The word seems to be an abbreviation of &quot;puncheon,&quot; which was the name of the cask from which grog used to be served on English ships. - Mulled Wine

7308,2,,2018-05-19T13:33:16.100,2,,"How do I get beer to chill to the maximum possible?

Here is a recipe for getting your beer to a perfect temperature without breaking the bottles when a freezer in itself may too cold and a fridge may not be cold enough. The following method is relatively inexpensive.


  Popping the beer in the fridge will take an hour to cool down. Even just sticking the beer in the freezer would take a good 20 minutes or so. This is just way too slow on a hot summer day. So, here’s how you can cool down a six pack in 3 minutes to the perfect drinkable temperature.
  
  What You Need:
  
  
  A six pack (bottles or cans)
  A bowl or pot large enough to fit the bodies of 6 bottles (preferably metal)
  Mixing Spoon
  2 trays of ice cubes
  1-2 Cups Table Salt
  Water
  
  
  How to Do It:
  
  1)Place bowl/pot in a sink.
  
  2)Add ice, salt, and enough water to fill up half of the bowl/pot.
  
  3)Stir until salt is dissolved.
  
  4)Add beers and make sure they are covered up to the neck with the icy water. You may need to add a bit more water.
  
  5)Place in the freezer (If you don’t, it may just take an extra minute or 2)
  
  6)After 3 minutes, pull the beers out. You should find that they are at the perfect temperature.
  
  How It Works:
  
  The trick is in the salt. It may sound unusual considering that in winter, we drop salt on the ice to raise the temperature and make it melt, but in this case, the salt is tricked into cooling the beer. Since the salt does in fact melt the ice, it goes through a transition from a solid to liquid. When this occurs, it absorbs extra heat which keeps the water extra cold. In this case, the excess heat comes from the beers and the liquid more actively cools them. - Cool a Beer in 3 Minutes

I took a class a few years back on pairing tea with whiskey (or whisky). They were focused on serving the whiskey and tea separately rather than blending them, but blending can work nicely. I'm a fan of smokey malty Scotch — mostly the Islays — and it blends nicely with a powerful black tea. If you really dig the smoke flavor, blend an Islay Scotch with a lapsang souchong or Russian Caravan tea.

The glass is filled up with brown rum which has a Vol% between 38 and 40 of alcohol. It is possible to mix and use it immediately, but most people just put it aside for a while. 

After some time the fluid of rum becomes glutinous and the surface of the rock candy becomes soft. When this mixture is in that status they put some spoons of it into the cup and fill it up with black tea. Could be from Ceylon or comparable. When filling up with the hot tea the rock candy crashes internally and when mixing up the tea with it all it becomes a wonderful experience especially in wintertime.

An example of NO correlation at all is Glenfiddich 12 --> 15 --> 18.  The reason they do not correlate is that the flavors are unrelated.  12yr is fruity (apples, pears, etc), 15 is like honey mead, 18 tastes like smoked oak.

Also, there are wines made from blends of grapes such as found in the Southern Rhone. What I do recommend is seeing if you have a good local wine store. I'm lucky to have access to a few and you can get good advice from the salespeople. Good stores won't look down on you for starting with inexpensive wines. A lot of shops have free tastings which is a great way to try different wines without investing in a whole bottle. I was a bit confused by you implying you have had white Malbec. Malbec is a red wine grape and while it might be possible to make a white wine from it, I've never heard of one and it would certainly be uncommon. If you are getting started, you should probably try Chardonnays and Sauvignon Blancs for white wines although there are lots of other white wine grapes.

7334,2,,2018-06-12T16:01:33.903,1,,"There is indeed the possibility that a bottle of frozen beer does not break.

It depends mainly on the amount of alcohol in the beer and how the bottle was filled.

You can expect that a normal beer expands by approx. 6.5-7.5% in volume when you start cooling at approx. 20°C. If the bottleneck can contain this volume increase, the bottle should not break. This would be usually the case with homebrews. The exact amount depends on how much alcohol and solids are in the beer, as ethanol does not expand when the temperature is lowered and solids do not change their density significantly. 

Depending on the alcohol content and the temperature of the freezer, the beer might not even freeze solid, or at least not fully, as ethanol lowers the freezing point substantially.

With a bad freezer, high ambient temperature (e.g. on a hot summer day) or short freezing times, the possibility of breaking the bottles is rather low.

Because ice has a very low compressibility compared to water and ethanol, you cannot expect that better and thicker bottles will solve the problem unless they have the necessary amount of elasticity. You could weld your beer into 2 inch thick cast iron and it would break just like your glass bottle. A better container would, however, be less susceptible to leaks.

A modern beer can would most likely not survive the process because it deforms at the top and creates a leak at the lid.

Depending on its fermentation, it would contain different and different amounts of more complex fermentation products. Usually, a fermentation process that is very short (and thereby cheaper) would result in something that could easily cause a hangover. Wild yeast strains also tend to produce a larger variety of undesired substances. Modern distilleries have these removed during distillation allowing for faster fermentation. 

In beers and wines, undesired by-products cannot be removed. Modern breweries and vineyards deal with that by using cultivated yeast strains and/or controlling the fermentation environment, resulting in products that don't give you headache.

The amount of hops in standard beers is negligible. Even if there were enough hops in beer to have any effect, hops may not have sleep-inducing effects after all. Apparently, research indicating such effects was conducted in combination with valerian. 

The reason for adding hops to beer was its inhibiting effect on gram-negative bacteria. Nowadays, it's mostly added for its 'typical' beer flavour.

the grape variety
the ripening conditions of the grapes (includes climate, region, year, nutrients etc.)
secondary fermentation (type oak, time etc.)
yeast strain(s) (cultivated or wild etc)
style (e.g. beaujolais, ice wine etc.)


Information about the secondary fermentation could give you an idea how the wine tastes, especially about oak tannins. 

Information about the yeast strains would most likely either be a trade secret or a mix of wild yeasts that depends on the natural blend that occurred in that year in that particular vineyard. This is, at least to some extent, what creates the difference between ""a good vintage"" and a bad one.

The effect of the grape variety on the actual taste is often overrated. Oak flavours are sometimes more dominant than most people would imagine and the same variety grown in different regions can create entirely different profiles.

Instead of looking for certain varieties, I would suggest considering information about wine regions, vineyards, alcohol content and, if given, descriptions on tannins, oak and fruit flavours. Third party reviews might help but there is never a guarantee that they are in any way correct.

IBU is btw a bad way to measure bitterness in most beers where is matters. It entirely neglects large portions of the flavour profile found in hops, in particular those that give an IPA its typical taste. The bitterness also changes with time, which is not accounted for either. Bitterness also changes with stronger beers. The higher the malt content, the more hops you need to compensate for the same taste.

Any sugars that can be fermented, would ferment at different speeds. As there is usually more than one kind of sugar present, the easy ones ferment first until the alcohol kills off the yeast, leaving the more difficult ones behind. Fermentation usually continues at that point, just a lot more slowly.

The difference in the effect is minor as long as everything is fully fermented. An example of such a difference is fruit wines and beer. Fruit wines contain minor amounts of methanol while beer usually does not. Differences in flavour are more about what is not fermented.

Other variables that could effect its flavour are:


changes in altitude (not during flight)

bottling problems (oxygen in bottleneck)
difference between drinking and ambient temperature (e.g. beers taste different in summer and winter)
olfactory changes (flu, humidity, ambient smells)

transporting bottles that are not so fresh (closer to their exp. date)


Pure speculation/unlikely:


cosmic radiation
altitude changes during flight irreversible


Any of the above mentioned changes in temperature as well as choosing a glass instead of a bottle etc. effect CO² in various ways. This results in a different drinking sensation (the tingling in the nose; try ""smelling"" the CO² and compare with a flat beer) and different taste (pH). 

Humidity, climate, season could alter your perception. An imperial stout for instance takes you over the edge in summer while you would feel perfectly fine in winter.

Ambient temperature has an immense effect on the beer. It effects nearly everything from how much CO² is released upon opening the bottles to what the perfect drinking temperature is. The drinking temperature has an immense effect on how strong hops, sugars and alcohol taste.

Such changes in taste are not unheard of and more likely to occur in strong, malty beers. Flights are not necessary to have such an effect. Any long-distance transport would do.

In chemistry lab there are two alcohol solvents used:
1.  Medical Grade (surgical alcohol) = 95% Alcohol (getting that last 0.57% is very time consuming to achieve)
2.  (benzene) Alcohol = 98% Alcohol (with 2% benzene still in solution with the alcohol)

Benzene is used to drive off or get all of the 5% of water out of distilled alcohol. The (benzene) Alcohol will make you sick because of the benzene. 

Surgical alcohol provides the most wonderful drunk. It is a body drunk with zero dizziness. 

Dizziness comes from the long chain fusel oil(s) (alcohols) in fermented alcohol. Fusel oil alcohols are not present in surgical alcohol. All fusel oil alcohols boil off at a different, slightly higher temperature than ethanol (drinking alcohol). Sloppy or rushed distilling gets the higher temperature fusel oil alcohols coming over with the ethanol. Really sloppy and very rushed distilling gets the first run methyl alcohol, methanol . . . which causes permanent eyesight loss. Long chain alcohols cause much of the hangover effect of headaches.

Yeasts produce fusel oils when they struggle to produce higher percentage alcohol levels in wines and beers.

Glass column . . . fill with glass beads. Exit point ==> condensation coil.

Why? 

The glass beads cause vapors to condense while being boiled off (lighter vapor rises higher up the column).  

And thus different alcohols are separated from each other without having to have a Super Tall tower.

A column of vapor has increasingly higher temperature(s) toward the top, lower temperature(s) toward the bottom.
Lighter (less dense) molecules heat up first and rise to the top [e.g. Methanol (ethyl alcohol); that make you go blind].
Lighter alcohols come off first (rise to the exit point), to then condense traveling through a chilled condensation tube.
After all the lighter methyl alcohol is gone (thrown away, or stored separately as a cleaner solvent), the temperature jumps up to the next more complex, more dense, alcohol. That specific temperature is exact. 

With a thermometer tip (or sensor) placed within the exit point you know when a temperature change occurs. THIS is how you know you are starting to take off ETHANOL, the drinking alcohol. The next alcohol to come off (after methanol) would be ETHANOL . . . that is safe to drink.

Just as Matt Fitzgerald said above: “A simple (but effective) rule of thumb for this is to throw away the first 50 mL you collect (per 20 L mash used) for a reflux still. If using a potstill, make it more like 100-200 mL. Do this, and you have removed all the hazardous foreshots, including the methanol.”

The base idea is that proteins &amp; yeasts in the beer (which cause haze) will clump together because of the cold - with the implication that somehow this provides better filtering.

The truth of it is that no beer is filtered at non-cold temperatures.

Filtering can make a very ""bright"" beer - that is, it is clear.  Filtering is done with different technologies, and down to different levels.  Some beer styles are not filtered at all (e.g. German Hefeweizens - cloudy wheat beers) as are many craft beers, whereas others are filtered to the point where just about all particulates - including yeasts and suspended proteins are removed.

Traditionally, lagered beers had a long time for the yeast etc. to settle out, thus producing an quite bright beer without filtering.  Many home brewers use this technique too.

Filtering can remove a lot of flavour from the beverage, but it does increase shelf-stability and product longevity.

7357,2,,2018-06-28T16:32:52.923,4,,"From a home-brewing point of view: cold-crashing is when you take your fermenting/ed wort and stick it in the refrigerator causing the yeast to become inactive and/or fall out of solution. It can be used as a way to quickly stop fermentation if a desired ABV (% alcohol) has been reached. However, the more common reason this is done is to bring clarity to the beer more quickly. The even less common answer is fractional freezing to increase the ABV.  

99/100 times the answer is cold-crashing/chill-filtering is a way to bring clarity to the beer. As the beer brews and yeast becomes inactive, it falls out of solution to the bottom (there is a difference on where fermentation occurs in ales v lagers) forming a ""trub."" Even if you let the beer set in a still, sterile environment for months... you can still get more yeast to fall out of solution by bringing the temperature down a considerable amount. There are definitely times that you don't want this to happen as the yeast strains also impart flavors to beers. The ""banana esters"" you get (or that some perceive) from Belgian beers actually comes from the yeast that remain in the beer. Here is a quick run down of identifying yeast flavors and what you should anticipate tasting in some styles. Here is a neat info-graphic from brew-dog that talks about yeast in the brewing process, how some strains impart flavors, and what the options are for ""finishing"" your beer.     

Stopping the fermentation too soon can leave unwanted flavors in your beer. The one that immediately comes to mind is Diacetyl. This PDF is an explanation of the timeline for the creation of Diacetyl in the fermenting process. They tend to produce butter flavors but are considered undesirable in higher concentration by BJCP (beer judge certification program). Here is a list of 15 common off-flavors, their sources, and how they affect beers. 

Fractional freezing is not a filtration method. It is being included because we're talking about making beer cold before we're packaging it. Because beer yeast can't survive in concentrations >14% ABV... Making it so cold the water freezes and can be removed before the alcohol portion freezes is a way to concentrate and jack-up the %ABV. Here is a link from PopSci talking about fractional freezing more in depth.

All of this just to say - Chill filtering has a time and a place in beers depending on what you want the end result of your brew to be. The real reason anyone touts a process in advertising is just to help differentiate themselves from the competition. Miller Lite always advertises ""Triple Hops Brewed"" like it is innovative. Really, adding hops at the beginning of the brew impart bitterness, middle of the brew is some bitter more flavor, end is almost purely for aromatic purposes. A lot of beers you have will have been brewed with hops placed into the the process at three different times.

I've heard the hobbyist brewers describe the grains as something that is basically readily edible and a great material to make tea out of by just steeping some in hot water, but I was never able to get enough information about that from the streams or texts, as it's not their main focus. So I decided to ask here.

There are exotic teas which are not teas at all, but collections of herbs or just a single herb or grain. Buckwheat tea is nice and I like the product called ""barley tea"". I don't know for sure whether it's actually what it says on the label, or if there are parts of grains which are usable as tea ingredients and parts which aren't, so I'd like to know everything about turning some tasty grains into non-alcoholic tea by just steeping them in hot water for some minutes.

For the sake of clarity, my questions are:


Are there any beer brewing ingredients usable in making an ""herbal tea""?
Do the flavors which are normally expected to be found in beer after it's ready for pouring into glasses after a long time of sitting in kegs, translate into the tea which steeps for just minutes?
If there's a gradation, which ingredients are the most appropriate for turning into tea?
And lastly, if you have any recommendations, please throw them in at the end of your answer.

7362,2,,2018-06-30T01:55:45.400,4,,"Whew! There are a lot of good questions in your question! To get the credentials out of the way, I'm a tea writer that owns a tea tavern and has done quite a bit of homebrewing (I've also made some tea beer, which may interest you).

First, the only ""official"" ingredients of beer (if you follow the Reinheitsgebot, or Bavarian Purity Law) are barley, water, hops, and yeast. Similarly, ""real"" tea is made only from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, but ""herbal"" tea consists of pretty much any leaf, stem, root, seed, or flower you want to steep in water.

With that covered, we can move on to common terminology, where beer can contain a variety of different grains, like malted and unmalted barley, wheat, oats, rye, and corn. I've even used more exotic grains like triticale in a homebrew. A lot of adjuncts are often added, too, ranging from honey to berries, juniper buds, and every imaginable spice.

So, as to question 1: Yes, you can use beer brewing ingredients for making herbal teas. You'll want to blend them, though. Steeping straight hops doesn't make for a great drink. If you steep the hops for 3-5 minutes in boiling water, most of the aromatic oils will evaporate and most of the bittering agents won't have a chance to take effect. It's pretty meh. Blend hops with tea leaves or other herbs, though, and you can make an interesting drink.

Question 2: Very little of the flavor of a typical beer develops in the keg. It develops during the boil and the primary/secondary fermentation steps. Once it hits the bottle (or keg), beer is ready to drink. You can certainly toss barley in boiling water and let it steep a while to make a drink, but without the fermentation process, it won't taste a whole lot like beer. That doesn't mean it won't be good — especially when blended with herbs — but it won't be beer.

Question 3: Since you're using water to make both tea and beer, and yeast has no place in tea, you're really asking whether barley or hops makes a better tea. It depends on your personal taste. I'd probably say hops.

And Question 4: I'll give you the same recommendation I'd give any homebrewer or tea lover: experiment. Hops are pretty cheap. Buy some (the flowers, not the pellets), get some teas with flavor bases you like, and play around. Malted barley is cheap enough that you can probably talk a homebrewer into giving you a couple of pounds, especially if you trade for a six-pack.

Good luck, and let us know how your experiments turn out!

Ed C. Kraus, a 3rd generation home brewer/winemaker and has been an owner of E. C. Kraus since 1999 has 4 possible reasons why a wine may have a salty taste. He has been helping individuals make better wine and beer for over 25 years.


  My first thought would be that if you are aging in a wooden barrel, the remnant salts from the sodium metabisulfite may have built up over the years through insufficient rinsing or no rinsing at all. But this is very unlikely. If you make any kind of conscious effort to rinse a barrel you would be able to keep up with the trace amount of salts that are left behind with each wine batch. 
  
  My second thought is that a mistake was made in a dosage added to a wine/must. For instance, yeast nutrient (diammonium phosphate) would add what some would call a salty taste to the wine if too much were added, but this would take many times the normal recommend dosage.
  
  Third would be saltiness from the grapes themselves. This could add a salty taste in wine. This could apply if you made the wine from fresh grapes from a vineyard. The mineral content of the soil is always reflected in the grape’s flavor to some degree. This is one of the reasons a grape’s origin is always noted. If you are making wine for the first time from a particular soil or terroir, then this is what could be going on.
  
  The fourth thing that comes to mind is a mold infection. The only reason I left this for last is because it is the least likely of the four. This is because by the time the wine has a salty taste from mold, it is already blatantly obvious from a visual inspection that mold as set in. So if you don’t see any patches of dried crust on the surface anywhere, or a rainbow-ed, oil-slick look on the wine’s surface, the salty taste in the wine is not being caused by a mold.
  
  Beyond these things the only thing that comes to mind is accidentally putting salt in the wine.

7367,2,,2018-07-02T15:03:00.013,3,,"The answer really depends on what you're looking for in the drink.  

1) The hotter the whiskey the more rapid the alcohol evaporates out and more of the bitter-notes shine through. Adding ice is cold + water which can also mask some of the whiskey characteristics while taking away some of the ""harsh"" fore taste of the whiskey.


  *Whiskey stones could be a good alternative if you want cooler whiskey without the effects of the water.


2) The Perrier Water is going to add some fizz + bring the whiskey toward the temperature of the Perrier. The cooler the Perrier, the more the temperature drop on the finished product will be. Conversly, the hotter the Perrier is served, the more rapid the loss of CO2 will be. 


  *Freezing the Perrier (or being cold enough to almost freeze) can be dangerous because the H2O (32ºF/0ºC) freeze before the CO2 (-109.3ºF/-78.5ºC) causing a lot of pressure and potentially an pressurized explosion to occur.


3) The ideal ratio of Perrier+Whiskey is going to solely depend on the imbiber's taste. The more Perrier, the more fizz and more ""watered down"" the final drink. The less Perrier, the less fizz and more whiskey you will taste.


  *Watered down is not being used in a negative connotation here. It is being used as a catch all to describe all of the ways water (carbonated or not) affect whiskey and other liquors. 


The real answer is... Experiment! 


  Try:



Johnny Walker, neat, at room temp.
Johnny walker, neat, chilled
Perrier at room temp.
Perrier chilled


Then measure out ratios based on what your perceptions were.
If you liked the Johnny Walker closer to room temp, both should be closer to room temp. Adding measured volumes of each until you achieve your perfect ratio. 


  *An important note: The reason you don't add ice on top of the Perrier is because of the dilution when the ice melts. Therefore you could add whiskey-stones that chill without the dilution.

7369,2,,2018-07-02T22:59:25.283,7,,"Yes, wine can pretty much be made from all edible fruit, including tomatoes. But the reason we make wine out of grapes is three fold. Sugar, tannins and acids. 


Sugar. Grapes produce the highest naturally occurring amount of sugar of any fruit. Almost no other fruit comes close. Grapes have the ability to make wines that are anywhere from 10-18% alcohol and even higher in the case of late harvest grapes that have too much sugar to finish alcohol production. 
Acid. Grapes have a very high naturally occurring acid levels coming from Tartaric acid. Acids help preserve wine and keep the nasty bugs from eating the sugar. They also make it more drinkable. Wine without any acid is flat and awful. It's like beer without hops.
Tannin. Red and white grapes contain tannin in both the skins and seeds. These are a natural antioxidant that help preserve the wine for long term storage. 


Since grapes have such natural high sugar levels, they also have large colonies of yeast on the skin (aka the bloom) and because of this, grapes are a complete package requiring nothing else to make a high alcohol beverage that can be stored for a very long time without spoiling. No other fruit has the right combination of attributes to do this on it's own.

Fruits which will produce no fermentable juices are simply not going to work. If you have to treat the fruits in such a way as to convert starches in order to get sugars to ferment, can you really call the product a ""wine"", even in a loose sense?

You are going to struggle mightily to produce wine from avocados or eggplants, for example... even limes are so low in sugar and high in acidity that even after neutralizing some acid you will have to add a bunch of sugar to have anything to ferment... in this case, you're really making a flavored kilju, rather than a wine.

And if you want to get technical about fruits, then ""all fruits"" is actually a very broad category. Brazil nuts, maple keys, and even carrot seeds are all fully-fledged fruits that are going to be very difficult or impossible to extract a fermentable juice from.

Of course, you could probably use a koji to first saccharify your initial base and produce something like a sake, but despite the colloquial misnomer ""rice wine"", if you're going to call this a wine, then you can do it with nearly anything: why limit yourself to fruits? Then is there really a further difference with kvass or even kumis. Is beer now wine?

This is completely discounting the whole classes of toxic fruits that you might be able to produce something technically alcoholic but definitely nondrinkable from, e.g. belladonna and other toxic nightshades, baneberries, etc.

Pairing rules are not set in stone, but there are a few friendly guidline to follow.


  Match Wine Flavors With Food Flavors
  
  Specific body and color types and their flavors are also elements to consider when you are pairing vegan foods and wine. For example, when choosing white wine, a light-bodied flavor, such as Vermentino, Pinot Grigio and Viognier all go well with pasta dishes, salads and stir-fry vegetables because they will not overpower the modest flavor of these foods. If you are barbecuing veggie burgers or preparing baked potatoes on the grill, consider choosing a classic white Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc or Riesling, which make a fine complement to the taste of grilled foods. 
  
  If you prefer red wine, then go with Granache for veggie burgers and sweet potatoes, and try a Merlot for olive-based dishes and grilled asparagus. The most important aspect of pairing wine with a vegan meal is to choose flavors that will not overpower the food. For example, avoid pairing a robust, full-bodied red wine with a simple summer salad or pairing a sweet wine with a tart pesto and lemon dish. 
  
  While you might make a few errors when you first start pairing wines and vegan dishes, you should never be afraid to experiment and come up with a few interesting combinations of you own. - 5 Tips for Pairing Wines With Vegan Dishes

In order to get your hands on some of the world’s best beer is truly a delicate process. To acquire some Westvleteren, you must call the ‘beer phone’ and place a reservation 60 days ahead of time. The phone line tends to be busy with 85,000 calls coming in every hour. Once you finally get to talk to an individual at the brewery, you will give your license plate number and set up a date and time in which you can pick up your order drive-thru style.
  
  While these methods may seem extreme, the monks are ultimately striving to eliminate commercial and illegal resales. There should be no pubs or bars supplying Westvleteren, and if they are, that means it’s considered a ‘gray market item.’ If you really can’t wait the 60 days, the abbey also owns a café and visitor’s center called In de Vrede, just across from the brewery, where beer can be bought on the premises to drink right away. - Westvleteren, Belgium's Most Secretive Brewery


Customers are limited to one case per person (per license plate) per 60 days.

Ararat after the biblical deluge? I am not interested if one believes in the story of Noah's Ark or not. Nor am I interested in any possible historical timeline for the great regional flood which spared Noah and his family.


  Noah's wine is a colloquial allusion meaning alcoholic beverages. The advent of this type of beverage and the discovery of fermentation are traditionally attributed, by explication from biblical sources, to Noah. The phrase has been used in both fictional and nonfictional literature. 
  
  ""Noah's wine"" refers to alcoholic beverages. In the Bible, the few chapters that come between the creation of Adam and the birth of Noah contain no mention of alcoholic drinks. After the account of the great flood, the biblical Noah is said to have cultivated a vineyard, made wine, and become intoxicated. Thus, the discovery of fermentation is traditionally attributed to Noah because this is the first time alcohol appears in the Bible. Noah's wine has been described as a ""pleasant relief for man from the toilsome work of the crop"". 
  
  From a biblical view, fermented beverages presumably spread throughout the world after Noah's supposed discovery, as alcoholic beverages are historically widespread. - Noah's wine (Wikipedia)


Is there a modern wine, commercially available today, that is intended to resemble the ancient Noah's wine as closely as possible from any of his many possible timelines (more or less)?

Saperavi is a teinturier grape which means it has both red skin and flesh. Most red grapes only have red skin and clear flesh. They can be very powerfully colored and are many times used to color wines that need a little help in the color department. A well known teinturier in California is Alicante Bouschet which at one time was one of the most grown grapes in California. I suspect if you could track down a off dry California Alicante Bouschet it would have a similar flavor profile. There are Saperavi grapes in California, but I don't know a winery using them.

Never grafted and on its own roots, it is 100% indigenous to this land with a unique DNA proﬁle that does not match any other.

  The Cradle of Vine and Wine
  
  One of the world’s oldest civilizations, steeped in a history and tradition that dates back millennia, Armenia’s territory lies in the southern Trans Caucasus in the highlands surrounding Biblical Mount Ararat. The Cradle of Vine and Wine, the vine has forever been present in the valleys of Armenia with the wild Vitis vinifera silvestris, ancestor of the cultivated vinifera vine species, already established in its highlands over a million years ago.
  
  It is also of course in Armenia, at the foothills of Biblical Mount Ararat, where legend has Noah, the world’s first vigneron, plant his vineyards and later became famously drunk on his own wine! - Armenia: The land of the beginning
  
  Championing Native Varieties
  
  Working uniquely with ancient native varieties the vines are planted on their own roots directly into rocky, limestone soils which have never seen Phylloxera and while ZORAH’S heirloom vineyards tell a story of times gone by, the younger vines, the cuttings of which come from ancient abandoned vineyards of a XIIIth Century monastery, show us vistas into a possible future. - Zorah Wines

That will depend on several things, such as the type of booze you drink, the amount you drink, the amount you eat and the amount of exercise you do daily.


  Drink responsibly
  
  Alcohol can either give you a beer belly or help you uncover your abs. After all, while one Archives of Internal Medicine study shows that people who put back one or two drinks a day are less likely to gain weight, research in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows that men consume an extra 433 calories on days they have just a couple of drinks.
  
  While lowered inhibitions and drink-fueled munchies have something to do with it, 61 percent of the caloric increase comes from the alcohol itself. So, if you're trying to lose weight while still enjoying the occasional drink, you'd better be wise about which drinks you choose. Here are the best and worst booze you can order.
  
  Best Wine
  
  Red or white, you can expect to consume roughly 100 to 120 calories per glass. (That's assuming, however, that you're drinking a standardized 5-ounce glass. Research from Iowa State and Cornell shows that people tend to over-pour by 12 percent.)
  
  However, there are some considerations to make when picking grapes: White wine typically contains fewer carbohydrates than does red wine, which makes a small difference in terms of calories, says Caroline Cederquist, M.D., author of The MD Factor and creator of bistroMD. Meanwhile, red wine is richer in antioxidants, and a 2014 study in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, red wine's ellargic acids delay the growth of fat cells while slowing the development of new ones.
  
  Vermouth
  
  ""A fortified wine with higher alcohol content and infused spices and herbs, vermouth is a calorie saver if you have it by itself—as it's commonly served in Europe,"" says Georgie Fear, R.D., author ofLean Habits for Lifelong Weight Loss. A 1.5-ounce serving contains a mere 64 calories, and typically contains about 15 to 18 percent alcohol, she says. Plus, research out of Budapest shows that it's jam-packed with polyphenol compounds, which may promote healthy weight loss.
  
  Still, remember that if you mix it into a Manhattan or martini, you're probably going to be consuming far more calories and sugar, Fear says.
  
  Straight Liquors
  
  When it comes to getting the most alcohol for the fewest calories, shots and straight booze are the way to go. ""There is not much of a difference 80-proof hard liquors,"" Cederquist says. ""They all have around the same number of calories and carbohydrates."" And as calories increase along with the alcohol content, the difference is not huge. For instance, a shot of 86-proof whiskey contains 105 calories and a shot of 80-proof vodka contains 97 calories.
  
  However, you also need to keep in mind that the sweeter the liquor, the more calories it typically contains, she says. ""If you're looking for a lower calorie alternative, avoid the flavored vodkas and spiced rums and go for the original or 'plain' option offered,"" she says. ""If you are looking for a flavor boost, try low-calorie mixers like a flavored seltzer or fresh squeezed lemon or lime. This will provide the taste without the calories.""
  
  Light Beers
  
  With fewer calories and carbs, these are the best brewskis for weight loss, Cederquist says. Many light beers contain 90 to 100 calories per 12 ounces, while extra-light beers pack about 55 to 65.
  
  However, just don't use that as an excuse to have more beers than you typically would, or you'll undo all benefits. Hey, they generally pack less alcohol, right? Well, yeah, but they actually tend to have a higher percentage of their calories coming from alcohol compared to standard brews. Budweiser Select 55 for example derives 88.2 percent of its calories from alcohol, compared to Bud Light at 74.1 percent, and regular Budweiser at 66.9 percent calories, Fear says.
  
  The Worst
  
  Sugar-Packed Cocktails
  
  ""Margaritas and Long Island Iced Teas can set you back more calories than a large order of McDonald's French Fries,"" Fear says. Even worse, calories from sugar-laden drinks come as a sneak attack. When you drink a marg, your body is so overwhelmed with the alcohol content that your body doesn't properly metabolize the sugar. Instead, it stores the sweet stuff as fat.
  
  There is never a good excuse to drink these and other sugar-filled cocktails especially if you are trying to lose weight or not develop diabetes, she says. Now, if you've got a skilled mixologist behind your bar, you're probably calorically safe ordering a cocktail. After all, he'd never serve up one of these artless offenses.
  
  High-Alcohol Craft Beers
  
  ""The last five years have seen an explosion of craft breweries creating high-alcohol varieties, which pack more calories per bottle than you may realize,"" Fear says. Remember, more alcohol means more calories. Every gram of the good stuff contains seven calories.
  
  For instance, Flying Dog Horn Dog, which contains 10.2 percent alcohol by volume, also contains 314 calories per bottle, and Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA boasts 18 percent alcohol by volume, but also packs 450 calories into each bottle. That's a meal in a glass. Unfortunately, though, all that alcohol can wind up making you hungrier. - The Best and Worst Booze to Drink if You Want to Lose Weight

The storage time at the temperature is obviously also a factor.

The changes also depend on the type of beer being stored.  If the beer is a pasteurised and/or completely filtered product, typically all yeast and suspended proteins have been removed.  Yeast can't autolyze if they have been removed.

Hop-forward beers will lose their flavour, ""hoppiness"" much quicker if stored warm - even when stored properly, it's best to drink these beers sooner rather than cellar them.  I keep all my hoppy beers refrigerated at all times (handle them like dairy products).

As a rule of thumb, cellar your beers around 10C / 50F without much variation.

7396,2,,2018-07-22T23:13:20.353,0,,"While ""Wayne in Yak"" pretty much covers ideal serving temperatures, I would like to add some sensory information.

When you drink or eat very cold foods &amp; beverages, the low temperature inhibits the operation of your taste buds and other olfactory tasting parts of your body.

Here's a quick experiment: taste a room-temperature soda/soft-drink Vs a refrigerated soft drink.  The warm version tastes much sweeter.  The sweetness of the beverage is calibrated for consumption at a low temperature.  It's too sweet drinking it warm.

Sometimes on hot summer days, a cold &amp; frosty beer is great.  I wont disagree there.  But the point is - if the beverage is too cold, you physically can't taste it very well.  

This is why many establishments do not freeze their glasses.  Just like steaks, soup and ice-cream, there's a specific temperature range at which the producer thinks the product is best.

In places where the ambient temperature is over 30C / 86F, then it makes sense to cool the glasses.  But here the idea here is that when the beverage at temperature-X is combined with a heavy glass at temperature-Y, the final resultant temperature should be in that ideal serving range.

Here is one way to make Jailhouse Brew:


  Pruno is a type of easy homemade fruit wine that’s often made by inmates in prison. Because pruno is typically made with makeshift ingredients, it doesn’t always taste very good. Making pruno is quite simple, but some recipes create the perfect environment for Clostridium botulinum. This is a bacterium that causes botulism, a form of food poisoning that can be fatal. Because of this, you must be very careful when you're making this homemade wine.
  
  Ingredients
  
  Artisan Pruno
  
  
  10 oranges, peeled and roughly chopped
  10 apples, roughly chopped
  1 cup (225 g) plus one tablespoon (14 g) sugar
  2¼ teaspoons (one 7-gram package) yeast
  3 cups (711 ml) water
  1 cup (227 g) fruit cocktail
  1½ ounces (43 g) raisins
  
  
  Minimalist Pruno
  
  
  10 oranges, peeled
  1 cup (227 grams) fruit cocktail
  2 cups (474 ml) water
  6 teaspoons (30 g) ketchup
  
  
  Making Artisan Pruno
  
  
  
  Method 1
  
  1 Gather your supplies. Traditional pruno made by inmates is made with few supplies and the ingredients that are available in prison. But at home, you can also make your own version of pruno using all the convenient equipment and ingredients available in a modern kitchen. To make artisan pruno at home, you'll need: 
  
  •Immersion blender
  
  •Wooden spoon
  
  •Large saucepan
  
  •Small bowl
  
  •One-gallon (3.8-L) sealable plastic bag
  
  •Clean bath towel
  
  •Heating pad
  
  •Strainer
  
  •Cheesecloth
  
  •Large bowl
  
  •Funnel
  
  •Large sterile bottle or jar with lid
  
  2 Puree the fruit. Combine the apple and orange chunks, plus the fruit cocktail and raisins, in a large saucepan. Use the immersion blender to puree the fruit until it’s juicy and pulpy, but still has some bite-sized chunks in it. 
  
  •Make sure to move the immersion blender around in the bowl as you blend, to ensure the fruit is pureed evenly.
  
  3 Boil the fruit, sugar, and water. When the fruit is ready, add the 1 cup (225 g) of sugar and 2 cups (474 ml) of the water and stir to combine. Put on the lid, transfer the fruit mixture to the stove, and bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning. 
  
  •Once the fruit comes to a boil, let it simmer for 30 minutes to kill any bacteria that may be present. Continue stirring the mixture regularly.
  
  4 Cool the fruit. After the fruit boils for 30 minutes, remove it from the heat and let it cool. You don’t want it completely cold, but slightly above room temperature to help the yeast flourish. As the fruit cools, continue stirring from time to time so it cools evenly.
  
  •The cooling process will take about 30 minutes to an hour
  
  5 Activate the yeast. Combine the yeast, the 1 cup of warm water, and the 3 teaspoons of sugar in a bowl. Set the bowl aside for five to 10 minutes to let it activate.
  
  •As the yeast comes to life, it will begin to froth and bubble in the bowl.
  
  6 Add the yeast and transfer the mixture to the bag. Pour the yeast mixture over the fruit and stir to fully combine. Transfer the mixture to the plastic bag. Press out as much air as you can, then seal the bag.
  
  •It’s important to warm the fruit mixture because the yeast will die if it gets too cold.
  
  7 Store the mixture somewhere warm and dark. Wrap the fruit mixture in a clean bath towel to help keep in the heat. Then place the towel on top of an electric heating pad turned to low temperature. Transfer the fruit, towel, and heating pad to a dark place, such as a closet. 
  
  •If you don’t have an electric heating pad, fill a hot water bottle with warm water. Be sure to check on the water ever six to 12 hours, and add fresh warm water as necessary when the bottle starts to get cold.
  
  •The reason you have to keep the fruit mixture warm is so the yeast will stay alive to ferment the fruit and turn it to alcohol.
  
  8 Burp the bag daily. As the yeast converts the sugars in the bag to alcohol and carbon dioxide, the bag will slowly fill up with gas. To prevent it from bursting, remove the bag from the towel once or twice a day and open the bag to release the gas and pressure. 
  
  •Reseal the bag, wrap it back in the towel, and return it to its dark spot on the heating pad.
  
  •When the mixture stops bloating, it means the yeast has converted all the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide, meaning the pruno is ready. This will take about five days.
  
  9 Strain the pruno. When the mixture has stopped bloating, it’s ready to strain. Place a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a bowl. Pour the fruit mixture into the strainer and let the juice drain down into the bowl.
  
  •To get the most juice out, wring out the cheesecloth with the fruit still inside
  
  10 Transfer to a bottle and chill before serving. Place the funnel inside the neck of a sterile glass jar or bottle. Pour the pruno into the bottle. Transfer the bottle to the fridge and allow it to chill for several hours or overnight. 
  
  •A large mason jar will work to store your pruno, or a large two-liter pop bottle.

If the whole table says it's a gold, then they give it a double gold.

There are Platinum awards too. Another group of judges (not from the same contest) taste all the Double Golds from a region or something from other contests and give Platinums. It's all a subjective thing based on the contest. There is no coordination among contests on what a double gold means.

Anything you buy in the store could more accurately be called white liquor, grain liquor or corn liquor, depending on the mash stock.

A key feature of both legally and illegally produced Moonshine is that it's unaged.  It goes straight from the still into the jar or jug. This facet was born of the need to make quick profits, the need to minimize the amount of evidence on hand in the event of a raid, and by extension, get your liquor into the hands of paying customers before the revenuers could find it.

Physically speaking, there is no real difference between vodka and moonshine.  Both are unaged neutral spirits, usually cut with water to increase volume and produce a more drinkable product.  The difference is mostly geographic. Moonshine, at least commercial varieties, can easily be called American Vodka, much like Poitin could be called Irish vodka.

George Drew, 87, British POW Brewed Turnip Hooch at Colditz 


  Major George Drew, who has died aged 87, helped his fellow prisoners to cope with the boredom and deprivations of Colditz Castle during World War II by producing potent homemade alcohol.
  
  He and his friend Pat Fergusson first tried to brew from the sugar and raisins from Red Cross parcels, but failed. Then they realized that there was sufficient sugar for fermentation in the turnip jam supplied by the Germans. Mixing the jam with yeast and water, they used a piece of purloined drainpipe and a large can, sealed with plaster of Paris from the sick bay, to produce hooch for such events as St. Valentine's and St. Patrick's Days.
  
  However, the effects of the more than 100 proof alcohol could be severe, even leading to temporary blindness. Dental fillings would fall out. If a man was having obvious difficulty walking and talking in the castle yard it was said that he was ""jam happy.""
  
  When Drew and Fergusson took part in the British television series ""Escape From Colditz"" in 2000, they made their potion for the first time since 1945. Taking the first glass before the camera, Drew said ""Dear God,"" remarked that the smell was not quite as bad as it used to be, then drank again. ""Oh Christ,"" he gasped.


And although not brewed, a group of tunnelers, after nine months of digging, took a wrong turn and emerged, fortuitously, in the castle’s wine cellar, enjoying 137 bottles, about four and a half bottles per person.

7417,2,,2018-08-03T12:33:38.717,8,,"I was surprised at how tough it was to track down anything that clearly mentioned both.

Firstly, from several recipes, including this one, it seems that simple syrup is made, as you might expect, by dissolving sugar into an equal amount of water and then cooling.

When it comes to invert sugar, recipes seem to call for more sugar and possibly an acid, be it cream of tartar or citric acid (sometimes via lemon juice) to help catalyze the inversion of the sugar.  On top of that, they often call for boiling until a temperature of 236 °F (114 °C).  This process effectively breaks downs the bond between the glucose and fructose molecules that make up the sucrose.

This page explains that water activity (correlated with spoilage) is better minimized by monosaccharides, while simple syrup generally only contains sucrose, a disaccharide.  It then goes on to describe a method for making ""partially inverted sugar syrup"" and calls either for acid or more sugar, as well as boiling for 20 minutes.  Since this process is less exact and does less to force the system to break down the sucrose it's easy to see why it's ""partially"" inverting the sugar.

So to directly answer your question, there is difference. Simple syrup is effectively just sugar (sucrose) dissolved in water, while invert sugar/syrup is dissolved sugar that has been processed to break it down into its component sugars (glucose and fructose).  Invert sugar should be slightly sweeter, thicker, and have a longer shelf-life.

Wikipedia has this to say about Rakija:


  Rakia or Rakija is the collective term for fruit brandy popular in the Balkans. The alcohol content of rakia is normally 40% ABV, but home-produced rakia can be stronger (typically 50%). 
  
  Common flavours are šljivovica, produced from plums, kajsija, produced from apricots, or grozdova/lozova in Bulgaria (raki rrushi in Albania), or ""lozovača"" or ""komovica"" in Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Bosnia produced from grapes, the same as ""Zivania"" in Cyprus. Fruits less commonly used are peaches, apples, pears, cherries, figs, blackberries, and quince. Similar spirits are produced in Romania, Moldova, Poland, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia and the Caucasus. In Albania, rakia is most commonly made out of grapes in mild climate regions and out of plums (and sometimes out of mulberry or walnuts) in colder climate areas. 
  
  Plum and grape rakia are sometimes mixed with other ingredients, such as herbs, honey, sour cherries and walnuts, after distillation. A popular home-made variant in Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Serbia is rakia produced from mixed fruits. In the Istrian and Dalmatian regions of Croatia, rakija tends to be home-made exclusively from grapes, where the drink is also known locally as trapa or grappa (the latter name also being used in Italy). 
  
  Normally, rakia is colorless, unless herbs or other ingredients are added. Some types of rakia are kept in wooden barrels (oak or mulberry) for extra aroma and a golden color. 
  
  It is supposed to be drunk from special small glasses which hold from 30 to 50 ml.
  
  Greek ouzo (from grape) and tsipouro (from pomace), Turkish rakı (from sun dried grapes) and arak in Lebanon and Levant region differ from rakia as they are redistilled with some herbs (commonly anise). Some tsipouro in Greece is made without anise in the same manner as pomace rakia (or pomace brandy). ""Boğma rakı"" in Turkey (common name of the domestic raki which is produced at homes and villages) is similar to rakia in the Balkans. 


Slivovitz is a fruit brandy made from damson plums. The primary producers are Bosnia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia. The usual proof of private-produced slivovice is over 50% of alcohol in the final product, commercially available mass-produced slivovice is proofed less. 


  Šljivovica is the national drink of Serbia in domestic production for centuries, and plum is the national fruit. Šljivovica has a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). Plum and its products are of great importance to Serbs and are a part of numerous traditional customs. A Serbian meal usually starts or ends with plum products and Šljivovica is served as an apéritif. A saying goes that the best place to build a house is where a plum tree grows the best. Traditionally, Šljivovica (commonly referred to as ""rakija"") is connected to a Serbian culture as a drink used at all important rites of passage (birth, baptism, military service, marriage, death, etc.). It is used in the Serbian Orthodox patron saint celebration, slava. It is used in numerous folk remedies, and is given certain degree of respect above all other alcoholic drinks. The fertile region of Šumadija in central Serbia is particularly known for its plums and Šljivovica. In 2004, over 400 000 litres of Šljivovica was produced in Serbia.  


Here follows a few sources on how to make some Raki (Brandy).

Making Rakija – The Basics: 


  Making rakija involves five main stages: harvest, preparation for fermentation, fermentation, distillation and aging &amp; storage.


How to Make Rakia (Ракия): 


  
  Select a Fruit. Rakia is typically made from fruit, so the first thing you need to do is choose one. Grape and plum rakias are the two most traditional varieties, but Bulgarians make rakia out of whatever is readily available and cheap – apple, pear, peach, apricot, and cherry rakias are all popular in certain parts of the country. Other varieties are made less frequently.
  Pick and Gather the Fruit. Once you’ve selected a fruit, you have to “pick” it. Picking a fruit is often as simple as going to the market and buying as much of it as you need. But grape vines and fruit trees grow aplenty in Bulgaria, and most Bulgarians hand-pick the fruit they use to make rakia. With grapes, this means waiting until the right time in fall and bringing together friends and family for a grape-picking weekend. With other fruits, Bulgarians typically wait until the fruit is slightly overripe and then they shake the fruit out of the tree by vigorously shaking the branches and/or swatting at the branches with a long stick. Only the fruit ripe enough to make rakia falls out of the tree, after which it is all collected.
  Make Juice. Once you’ve collected the fruit, you mash it up, make juice, and dump it into a large barrel. The mashing process can be done by machine or the old-fashioned way – by foot.
  Measure the Sugar Content and Add Dissolved Sugar as Necessary. After the fruit has been mashed into juice, you measure the concentration of sugar in the juice with a saccharometer (захаромер). An ideal reading for making rakia is 23°, and a sugary water solution of approximately three pounds of sugar to every gallon of water should be added to the mash until the ideal sugar level is attained.
  Stir the Juice and Allow it to Ferment. The fruit juice will settle to the bottom, and the fruit skins will harden and float to the top of the mash. To make sure the juice ferments, it is necessary to push the fruit skins down and stir the juice once daily. The amount of time for proper fermentation depends in large part on the weather, but fermentation generally takes around three weeks. You might notice that thousands upon thousands of fruit flies are attracted to the mash. Don’t fret. Believe it or not, fruit flies assist greatly in the fermentation process. As a matter of fact, the Bulgarian word for fruit fly, муха-винарка, takes its name from the Bulgarian word for wine, вино, and literally translates to wine fly. Not surprisingly, more than one Bulgarian friend of mine hopes someday to be reincarnated as a муха-винарка.
  Distill the Fermented Juice. Distillation day is one of the most enjoyable days of the entire process; it is the day when rakia begins to flow. There isn’t much to the distillation process, although some people do a double distillation while others only do a single distillation. Regardless, the initial steps are the same. The mash is dumped into a still, which is sealed with a flour mixture to insure the still is air tight, and then a fire is lit under the still and distillation commences. Then you sit and wait. It typically takes about an hour before the first alcohol fumes begin to separate from the mash. This steam then makes its way through the sealed pipes before working its way through a cooling condenser and emerging as rakia. As the alcohol collects, measurements are taken. When I made rakia, we did a double distillation. On the first distillation, our rakia started with an alcohol content of around 60%, and we stopped the distillation when the alcohol content dropped to 20%. We then emptied and cleaned the still, dumped the alcohol we had produced into the still, and started a second distillation. On the second distillation, our rakia started with an alcohol content of 75%, and we stopped the distillation when the alcohol content dropped to 40%. The finished product was a potent 124 proof rakia (62% alcohol).
  
  
  
  
  
  Age the Rakia. Once distillation is complete, your rakia is ready to drink. Some Bulgarians do nothing more, but most prefer to age and dilute their rakia to make it more pleasurable to drink. Rakia may be diluted by adding distilled water until the desired alcohol percentage is attained. It may be aged as long and in whatever manner you see fit, but most Bulgarians only age their rakia long enough to give it some color and a little taste. We aged our rakia in oak chips for a month and added distilled water to make it more drinkable at 90 proof (45% alcohol).
  Enjoy. Of course, the final step of the rakia making process is drinking it and sharing it with friends. Хайде наздраве!

7422,2,,2018-08-06T21:09:26.413,4,,"What is Tequila when its not from Mexico?


  Tequila is a regional distilled beverage and type of alcoholic drink made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila, 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, and in the highlands (Los Altos) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. Aside from differences in region of origin, tequila is a type of mescal (and the regions of production of the two drinks are overlapping). The distinction is that tequila must use only blue agave plants rather than any type of agave. Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime across the rest of the world. - Tequila (Wikipedia)


Within Mexico tequila terms are somewhat varied as follows:


  What’s The Difference: Tequila, Mezcal, Bacanora, Raicilla, Sotol?
  
  A wide range of spirits can be distilled from agaves. Here’s a quick rundown of that spectrum and a look at what defines each different category of agave spirits [from Mexico]:
  
  Tequila
  
  Tequila is a type of mezcal produced under strict regulations as to how and where it can be made. Tequila is fermented and distilled from a single type of agave plant, Agave tequilana Weber blue. Tequila is not smoky because the agave hearts are steamed or kilned during production; it can only be produced in Jalisco, and designated areas in four other Mexican states. 
  
  The best tequilas are 100% blue agave, which is noted on the label. Distinctions are often made between tequila made from blue agave grown in highland regions, which tend to be fruitier, and from lowlands, which are earthier. 
  
  Mezcal
  
  Mezcal is the over-arching category of Mexican spirits fermented and distilled from several varieties of the agave plant. It is produced all over Mexico under various names and designations, including tequila. 
  
  Bottles labeled “mezcal” are usually from the state of Oaxaca and often have a smoky flavor because during production the agave hearts are roasted in rock-lined pits fired by mesquite. 
  
  Bacanora
  
  Named for the eponymous town in Sonora, this mezcal variant is made from wild plants of agave Pacifica. Bacanora is often lighter and less smoky than most mezcals, even though the agaves are also pit roasted.
  
  Raicilla
  
  Like tequila, raicilla is made in Jalisco state; unlike tequila, it is made from two varieties of agave—lechuguilla and puta de mula. Raicilla tends to be sweeter and fruitier than most other mezcals. 
  
  Sotol
  
  Although a gringo might mistake it for agave, sotol is made from another succulent plant called Desert Spoon. Produced mainly in the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Durango and Coahuila, the process is similar to mezcal, with roasting of the hearts of Desert Spoon in volcanic rock-lined pits. Flavor varies according to the terroir, say aficionados; predominately herbal notes, as well as eucalyptus, pepper and cocoa, with lighter smoke accents.


Outside of Mexico Tequila and Mezcal are known as Agava in South Africa.


  Agava was also available in bottled form. Agave Distillers claimed to be moving between 12,000 and 15,000 cases a month at its peak. The bottled form has been sold in the LCBO, in Canada. 


Agava is labeled an agave product and not a tequila product.


  It should be noted that all Tequilas are agave spirits, but like Champagne or Port there is a protection of the Appellation of Origin in order to call it “Tequila”, so South African producers are forced to label their drink as Agave Spirit and not Tequila. - Tequila industry taking shape in South Africa 




In California, some are trying to name their agave product “El Ladron,""which means “the thief”. This too is not to be known as a tequila product, but as an agave spirit product.  

Before closing my answer, I would to mention that the first agave beverage that was ever fermented is known as Pulque.


  This sweet beverage has a long history in Mexico. Before mezcal or tequila, there was pulque, the first fermented agave beverage. Murals that date as far back as 200 A.D. in Cholula, Mexico show villagers drinking pulque. While it’s relatively low in alcohol and more like an agave beer, it was the agave beverage that started it all.
  
  Pulque is a product of the sap of the heart of agave. Rather than being distilled like mezcal or tequila, it’s fermented from the ""honey water"" of the plant. This sacred beverage has milky like appearance and is sweet in flavor. If you want a taste of Mexico, then try the fermented agave beverage that started it all. - From Tequila to Sotol, Your Guide to the Agave Spirits of Mexico

7425,2,,2018-08-09T15:17:33.850,3,,"I will try to answer your questions to the best of my ability.

Your description of your earlier wine makes me question you: 
Have you used a hydrometer to calculate the alcohol percentage of your earlier wines? 

If your wine tasted sweet after fermentation, it means your wine wasn't finished fermenting. If you bottle the wine and let it stay in room temperature with unfermented wine, then you may create bottle bombs.

Comparison between wild yeast and adding wine yeast:


Duration of Fermentation: Naturally occurring wild yeast will use longer time than wine yeast. Adding Wine yeast is a lot faster, and will substantially reduce the fermentation time.
Taste: The taste is subjective, where wine yeast may create a safer and cleaner taste, meanwhile wild yeast and other bacteria may produce 'unwanted flavors' or 'wanted flavors'. Everything depends on what you want. I don't know enough about the specific tastes to tell you here.
Alcohol percentage: I recommend using a hydrometer before and after fermentation to calculate the alcohol percentage of your wine. Adding wine yeast will eat up all the sugar in your wine very fast. 1-2 weeks, while wild yeast may use several months. Everything depends on how much yeast is present in the fermentation, temperature and how much sugar is in the unfermented wine.


Wild yeast takes time to grow into a culture which can eat up all the sugar, where wine yeast usually already has ~1 billion cells in the package.

Your beer is almost guaranteed to be safe to drink for humans. No pathogens like alcoholic beverages. If you have bacteria in your beer, you will just have another style of beer (see Sour Beer). 

Your beer could taste bad, but 1 year over expiration date is usually nothing serious. A lot depends on the type of beer + alcohol percentage + earlier exposure to oxygen + present bacteria in the beer.

When I brew Blondes, wheat beer or beers with belgian yeast, I'd rather have them condition in the bottle for several months before I drink them. Maybe your beer has become even better and more conditioned.

I am aware that I could find a special one-time release of some sort, but I am looking for a brand of scotch that routinely prints the year it was released somewhere on the bottle because when I have my second child a few years down the road, I would like to do the same thing for them, and I thought it would be nice if they were the same scotch. The closest thing that I can find is Booker's Small Batch Bourbon from Jim Beam. They do a few special releases a year, and the release year is printed on every bottle. If I cannot find a brand of scotch that does something similar I will just go with the Booker's. However, I thought I would ask this question here in case anyone is familiar with the sort of thing I am looking for. It would also be nice if it was a speyside or highland scotch, but that is not really necessary. I thank anyone in advance for taking the time to read this, and hopefully being able to point me in the right direction.

Best regards,
Josh

7429,2,,2018-08-10T16:06:19.063,1,,"I think there are two ways to look at this. Some distilleries do put the date when they bottled the whisky/scotch it will just take some leg work. Even cheap Old Turkey has a bottled date stamped on the label

Then the other way is to do some reverse math. There is such a thing as vintage whisky. Distilled and put into barrels in say 1990 and aged 25 years. So it would be bottled in the year 2015. Obviously you might have to wait until they bottle it the year someone is born. You can see some of this at the Glenfiddich website (unfortunately they have an ""are you old enough question"" to get past). 

The last option is to just buy a bottle of 20 year old whisky the year someone turns 20 (or whatever year you want) and just give it to them then when it's released by the distillery. Holding on to a bottle for 20 years or so can leave it vulnerable to all types of accidents. Don't risk it and just buy the bottle when they turn 21 or whatever age you want to bestow it upon them.

Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons! The main difference between scotch and whisky is geographic: they are made in Scotland.

Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons!


  Bourbon is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys.


What is Scotch?


  The main difference between scotch and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour).


What are whiskeys?


  Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak. 
  
  Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels. Whisky (Wikipedia)


Brandies are not whiskeys, but is a spirit produced by distilling wine.


  Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically drunk as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France. Brandy (Wikipedia)


What is Cognac?


  Cognac is a variety of brandy named after the town of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. 
  
  Cognac production falls under French Appellation d'origine contrôlée designation, with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Emilion, is most widely used.2 The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wine barrel age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer ""on the wood"" than the minimum legal requirement. 
  
  The white wine used in making cognac is very dry, acidic and thin. Though it has been characterized as ""virtually undrinkable"",4 it is excellent for distillation and aging. It may be made only from a strict list of grape varieties. In order for it to be considered a true cru, the wine must be at least 90% Ugni blanc (known in Italy as Trebbiano), Folle blanche and Colombard, while up to 10% of the grapes used can be Folignan, Jurançon blanc, Meslier St-François (also called Blanc Ramé), Sélect, Montils or Sémillon.5 Cognacs which are not to carry the name of a cru are freer in the allowed grape varieties, needing at least 90% Colombard, Folle blanche, Jurançon blanc, Meslier Saint-François, Montils, Sémillon, or Ugni blanc, and up to 10% Folignan or Sélect. Cognac (Wikipedia)


What is Armagnac brandy?


  Armagnac is a distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France. It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of cognac. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA). - Armagnac (brandy)


One last note. There also exists a liquor that is generally known as fruit brandy and is quite popular in various regions around the world.


  Fruit brandy or fruit spirit1 is a distilled beverage produced from mash, juice, wine or residues of culinary fruits. The term covers a broad class of spirits produced across the world, and typically excludes beverages made from grapes, which are referred to as plain brandy (when made from distillation from wine) or pomace brandy (when made directly from grape pomace). Apples, pears, apricots, plums and cherries are the most commonly used fruits. 
  
  According to a legal definition in the United States, a ""fruit brandy"" is distilled ""solely from the fermented juice or mash of whole, sound, ripe fruit, or from standard grape, citrus, or other fruit wine, with or without the addition of not more than 20 percent by weight of the pomace of such juice or wine, or 30 percent by volume of the lees of such wine, or both.""
  
  In the European Union, fruit brandies may not be labeled as ""fruit brandy""; instead, the legal English denomination is fruit spirit, which is ""produced exclusively by the alcoholic fermentation and distillation of fleshy fruit or must of such fruit, berries or vegetables, with or without stones"".4 A great number of European fruit brandies have a protected designation of origin, and are labeled with their respective protected names instead of ""fruit spirit"" (""apricot spirit"", etc.). Cider spirit and perry spirit (fruit brandy distilled from cider or perry) form a separate legal category. Some fruit spirits may be labeled with alternative names such as kirsch (cherry spirit) or slivovitz (plum spirit) regardless their country of origin.
  
  In British usage, ""fruit brandy"" may also refer to liqueurs obtained by maceration of whole fruits, juice or flavoring in a distilled beverage, and such liqueurs are legally labeled as ""cherry brandy"", ""apricot brandy"" etc. all across the European Union.1 Such beverages are used similar to cordials, and as an ingredient in cocktails and cakes. Fruit brandies obtained by distillation are often referred by the French term eau de vie.
  
  Fruit brandy usually contains 40% to 45% ABV (80 to 90 US proof). It is often colourless. Fruit brandy is customarily drunk chilled or over ice, but is occasionally mixed.

In terms of flavour and the experience while drinking, Brandy and Whisky are quite similar. If you gave a taste test to a beginner they could easily mistake one for the other.

At the same time, though, someone who was well versed in both liquors could likely distinguish between the two a majority of the time. While there are whiskies out there which border on cloying, brandy usually tends to be sweeter than most whiskies.

As far as I know, the flavour profiles for whisky are also much broader. That is, you're likely to see much more variation in the qualitative aspects of whisky than you are brandy.

  Some breweries will by back beer that is past its freshness date (Sam Adams is well-known for this), while some will split the cost with the distributor. - Beer - When good beer goes bad


I have had beers that were quite fine well after there expiration date. And I have had beers that were simply horrible after the expiation date. Cooler temperatures will prolong the lifespan of most beers. 

But how is expired beer typically disposed of by large retailers is a different matter?


  To avoid getting spoiled beer, check for a “brewed on” or “best by” date stamp, and avoid those that are not so labeled, especially if they have a fine layer of dust on them or visible sediment in the bottle (bottle-conditioned beers, however, are supposed to have a yeast sediment). Most pale ales, lagers and hefewiezens are best within three to six months of brewing. Darker beers and those with higher alcohol content might last a year. A few special beers are meant to be aged, but they are the exception rather than the rule. Beers stored in the cooler are less likely to spoil than those stored at room temperature, although many liquor stores stack case boxes on the floor, and those beers are less likely to be light-struck. 
  
  Some breweries will by back beer that is past its freshness date (Sam Adams is well-known for this), while some will split the cost with the distributor. In other cases, the retailer is left holding the bag for beer that did not move well. Still, liquor stores should not sell beer that has lost its quality. Let retailers know that a beer is expired or to return beers that you find to be stale (don’t do this just because you don’t like the beer — read some reviews of the beer and see what it is supposed to taste like). Check back in a few days and see how they have responded to your complaints.  If the expired beer is still on the shelf, let them know that you plan to shop elsewhere. - Beer - When good beer goes bad

The short answer is no.

Drinking mulled wine anytime of the year is more than okay. It can create an excellent atmosphere if done tastefully. I have served it myself on Easter Day to guests at my place and all enjoyed the spiced wine. Okay it was a little cold outside still, but that is besides the point. I live in Canada.

In Brazil, they drink Quentão, a type of mulled wine especially during summer festivals.


  In Brazil, we have some festivities on July, and in this period it's common to drink warm and hot wine, pure, or with some fruits and spices. It's called ""quentão"" and is usually made with cubes of apple and cinnamon. Res


Some recipes use cachaça (sugar cane brandy) in lieu of wine and is served very hot. 


  ""Quentão "" is a traditional ""Festas Juninas"" (winter party) grog cocktail, especially in the South Region, the coldest area of Brazil. Its irresistible scents combine sweet and spicy notes and it is traditionally served hot in small earthenware, ceramic or thick glass cups, which retain heat well. 
  It is a very popular cocktail recipe in the rural areas, and probably made its first appearance in the hinterland of São Paulo and Minas Gerais states. In absence of formal information, one would assume that this recipe is a variation of European mulled wine and grog recipes, made with ""cachaça"", the Brazilian national sugar cane spirits. In the 18th and 19th Centuries the consumption of ""cachaça"" has become synonymous of ""Brazilianness"" against Portuguese domination. After the ""Modern Art Week "" of 1922 it becomes a symbol of Brazilian cultural autonomy.
  
  The word ""quentão"" is derived from ""quente"" which means hot, plus the augmentative suffix -""ão"" (literally very hot). At the beginning of the 20th Century it came to designate the ""drink made by boiling sugar cane spirits with sugar, ginger and cinnamon. -  Quentão

One last note!


  Bonfire is taking Southern Alberta by storm, and it is warming hearts and melting colds.  It is a traditional European winter wine but also warms you up on cool summer nights. Bonfire is pre-mulled, so the only thing you need to do is warm the wine in either a pot or microwave. It is crafted from black currants, saskatoons, cinnamon and cloves.  The berry notes make it a great base for a perfectly balanced mulled wine and provide a much smoother finish than the traditional mulled wine made with grape wine due to the absence of tannins. Drinking it will make you feel like Christmas, no matter which time of the year.  It will warm you to the bone after a day of skiing, hockey, tobogganing, ice fishing, or around the bonfire on cool summer nights.  The perfect wine for Alberta winter and summer camping enjoyments. 
  
  Bonfire pairs great with Alberta weather winter weather and summer nights.

Flavors can mellow and blend into something very interesting to the palette.  Whites usually can follow suit, but their life span sans a few specific varieties, usually aren’t meant for aging and should be drunk young.  IMO few wines are really geared for long aging, notably ports, with their high alcohol levels age well into several decades, giving the drinker unique flavors as the years go by.  However, if a wine is flawed at conception, aging won’t make a purse out of a sow’s ear.

It might be the case that people who start with beer and end with liquor sometimes get sick because they loosen up with a beer buzz, and start drinking liquor too quickly. But there is no reason why the order of the two alcohols has to have this result if the people drinking stay moderate in how much they're consuming.

Conversely, if they ended with beer the rate of alcohol intake slows down meaning they'd be less likely to get sick. But they still could get sick.

In my experience when I was a young drinker there were a lot of sayings like this floating around. Usually just things that people said that sounded funny, rather than real warnings.

7470,2,,2018-09-06T12:13:51.607,5,,"There are some companies which  claim to make a maple sugar spirit. But at the same time, I can not verify if they use 100% maple sugar or not.

The really reason for people not using maple to make an alcohol spirit is the cost factor. Maple syrup is not cheap.  


  Why isn't there a liquor distilled from maple syrup?
  
  Too expensive.
  
  To make a liquor out of maple syrup, firstly you have to ferment the maple syrup (turning it into a wort), then distill said wort.
  
  A 10kg pack of Maris Otter (common variety of malted barley used in fermentation/distillation) will cost you approximately $15 AUD; genuinely maple syrup, would cost you about $5/500mL. I don’t need to put that through a volume converter to know that it will be exponentially more expensive to source 10kg of maple syrup for the same purpose.


Nevertheless some companies seem to be distilling maple sugar into a drinkable item.


  Tree Spirits Knotted Maple is probably the world's first store-sold maple syrup brandy. Bruce Olson and Steve Buchsbaum are the masterminds behind this spirited maple treat. The two of them originally opened up a winery, but as time progressed, they decided to experiment with apple cider and sap from maple trees.
  
  Tree Spirits Knotted Maple provides a unique drinking experience and you're paying for it. A 375-milliliter bottle of Knotted Maple costs $35.99. - Alcoholic Maple Drinks


Another company is marking a new Maple Vodka, but I am unable to verify for sure if the base ingredient is in fact maple sugar.


  The 80 proof Vodka is maple on the nose, clean and crisp, traditional in flavor, and finishes with a soft and delicate maple sweetness. This exclusive distillation, just shy of 1,600 bottles, will be available for sale from their tasting room and at events they attend throughout Vermont. - Caledonia Spirits to release new Vodka distilled from maple syrup on Saturday


Maple Sugar has been used for a number of years as an additive to make Maple Liqueurs, especially in Canada.


  Maple liqueur refers to various alcoholic products made from maple syrup, primarily in the Northeast United States and Canada. It is most commonly made by mixing Canadian rye whiskey and Canadian maple syrup. Maple liqueur is considered an important cultural beverage in certain Canadian festivals. 
  
  In Canadian French, such a product is known as eau de vie d'érable.
  
  Maple liqueur is not commonly found in liquor stores as it is easy to make at home. The production process is simple and does not require any special equipment. Homemade maple liqueur is both easy to make and inexpensive. It can be enjoyed on its own, in coffee, or in various different cocktails. - Maple liqueur

Which drinks are most popular in the winter?


The difference to me in which drinks to choose in the summer versus the winter comes from the temperature in which you're drinking. In the summer people typically crave something that is light, cool, and refreshing in the hot weather, where in the winter they want something that sticks to their bones and warms the cockles. Some examples:

Summer Drinks


Pilsner
Lager
Weiss
IPAs
Fruity cocktails (vodka, rum)
Caesars
Light bodied, medium to sweet wines


Winter Drinks


Stouts
Porters
Full bodied, dry red wines
Mulled Wine
Whisky
Brandy
Autumn or Winter (spiced) ales


Caveat

That said, really just drink and enjoy whatever you want, whenever you want. But in my experience it's usually the summer when I don't want the heavier drinks rather than vice versa. I'm much more likely to drink a light beer in the winter than something dark in the summer, although I'll drink whisky all year round.

7476,2,,2018-09-08T12:44:00.587,2,,"First of all, let us consider what can be turned into vinegar.


  What you can turn into vinegar? 
  
  Anything with sugar or starch can be fermented by yeast into alcohol, which can then be converted into acetic acid by acetobacter bacteria. The acidity of commercially made vinegar is at least 4 percent but not more than 7 percent, according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards. Vinegar has an almost indefinite shelf life, though some color changes and sedimentation (in unfiltered, unpasteurized bottlings) may occur. Some varieties are aged or reduced, which changes the flavor and character. 
  
  Wine based
  
  
  Banyuls
  Red wine, including varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon
  White wine, including varietals such as Champagne
  Sherry
  


For starters you must choose the wine (red or white) you desire to turn into vinegar, but do mix the two together. The more aromatic the wine is, the more flavorful the vinegar will be.

There are many recipes to make vinegar on the web, so I can only give a small sampling here. For the most part the techniques are somewhat similar.


  Mixing Wine Vinegar
  
  1. Choose your wine.  You can combine a few glasses of leftover wine or buy a fresh bottle to use. Don’t mix red and white wine together. Instead, either make white wine vinegar or red wine vinegar. Red wine vinegar is great for bold salad dressings and deglazing cooking pans. White wine vinegar is lovely in rich sauces and tart vinaigrettes.
  
  2. Find a “Mother of Vinegar”. This commercially available product is also called a vinegar starter or a mother. The bacteria in a mother creates vinegar when combined with wine, cider, or fresh fruit juice. You don’t have to use a mother when making wine vinegar. However, some people find that using a mother helps create wine vinegar faster.
  
  3. Choose a live vinegar. If you don’t want to purchase a mother, use a live vinegar instead. Look for vinegars that are advertised as “unpasteurized,” “unfiltered,” and “active”. For example, Braggs organic apple cider vinegar is a live vinegar.
  
  4. Mix the wine and starter together. Use a large, wide-mouthed jar or bowl made of nonreactive materials such as glass or ceramics.[4] Stir everything together well. This will evenly distribute the bacteria throughout the wine and aerate the mixture. 
  
  
  If you’re using a live vinegar, add 3 tablespoons of vinegar for every cup of wine.
  
  
  If you’re using a mother, follow the instructions on the package. Otherwise, add the mother to the wine and gently mix it in.
  
  
  
  5.Cover the jar with a cheesecloth. The cheesecloth will block out the light while letting air circulate through the mixture.[6] First, drape the cheesecloth loosely over the top of the jar. Next, secure the cheesecloth in place with a rubber band.
  
  Fermenting Wine Vinegar
  
  1. Set the container in a cool, dark place. Place your cheesecloth-covered container in a dark corner of a pantry or under your sink. Choose a spot that won’t get much light or heat. The vinegar will need to sit for two to three months while it ferments.
  
  
  The optimal temperature range is 75 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29 degrees Celsius.) If you store your vinegar outside of this range, the process will take longer.
  
  
  2. Monitor your vinegar. After three weeks of fermentation, examine the vinegar for a gelatinous film. This is the new mother. Try not to disturb this layer or you’ll risk agitating the bacteria that creates wine vinegar.
  
  3. Taste the vinegar for doneness. Begin tasting the wine vinegar periodically after one month of fermentation. To do so, gently push aside the mother with a spoon and gather a small sample of vinegar. You’re looking for a brightly tart, acidic taste.
  
  4. Harvest the vinegar. Once your vinegar tastes ready, it’s time to harvest it. First, use a spoon to push the mother down into the vinegar. Next, pour away the apple cider into a large bowl. While you pour, use the spoon to block the mother and keep it in the jar.
  
  5. Save the mother to use in new batch. Add more wine to the jar with the mother in it. Replace the cheesecloth and ferment the vinegar for another two to three months. Once the mother is used up, it will sink to the bottom and another mother will form on the vinegar. 
  
  
  Once the mother sinks all the way to the bottom, you can scoop it out and throw it away.
  You can use this method to create wine vinegar indefinitely.
  
  
  Storing Your Vinegar
  
  1. Choose a secondary storage container. Choose a heat-proof container that’s made of a nonreactive ceramic or glass material. The container should also come with an airtight lid or cork. For example, purchase a swing-top or sealable wine bottle. Some other examples of storage containers include: 
  
  
  Mason jars with lids
  
  
  An old empty vinegar container
  A glass beaker with a cork
  
  
  
  2. Sterilize your storage container. Wash the container with hot water and a strong dish soap. Next, bring a pot of water to boil on your stove. Submerge the container in boiling water for ten minutes to sterilize it. Allow it to air dry completely.
  
  Pour the vinegar into your storage container. Use a funnel to siphon the vinegar from the bowl to your storage container. Depending on how much vinegar you make, you may need two or three containers to collect everything. After pouring the vinegar, tightly secure the lid of the storage container. 
  
  
  Store your wine vinegar in a cool, dark place such as your pantry for up to one year.

  Slivovitz, often called slivovitsa, is a plum brandy found throughout Eastern Europe. The word ""slivovitz"" is based on the Serbian and Croatian name for a type of plum used to create the drink. Major producers in the Balkans and in Central European nations like the Czech Republic make commercial versions of slivovitz. In rural areas, many people make homemade slivovitz using makeshift stills made from old barrels. In the Czech Republic, this kind of home distilling is now illegal, though lightly regulated community-owned stills are a legal alternative. In Serbia, slivovitz is almost always a part of important events such as celebration of a birth or a wedding reception. The liquor is usually drunk neat because it is said that the flavor of the plums is at its most noticeable at room temperature. Like other types of brandy, slivovitz has a sweet edge. Because so many varieties exist, strengths vary wildly. However, most good slivovitz is between 80 and 100 proof, though homemade versions can be much stronger than that. - Beyond whiskey: 7 exotic spirits worth a try

7488,2,,2018-09-16T23:01:25.093,4,,"What is the evolution of brewing beer in Japan?

Beer in Japan seems to have had its start in the 17th century during the Edo period when Dutch traders stationed at Dejima in Nagasaki opened a beer hall for sailors working the trade route between Japan and the Dutch Empire.


  The Dutch started brewing beer for their own use in Nagasaki during the Edo Period. The first brewery to serve the Japanese market was founded in 1869 in the international port town of Yokohama by a foreign businessman. After changes in ownership, it started producing Kirin-branded beer in 1888. Meanwhile in Sapporo, the government built a beer brewery and established the Sapporo Beer brand in 1876 as part of its efforts to develop the island of Hokkaido. Accordingly, Yokohama and Sapporo vie for the title of birthplace of Japanese beer.
  
  The popularity of beer increased sharply in the second half of the 20th century, and beer has long since overtaken sake as the nation's favorite tipple. In recent decades, some Japanese beers have also gained popularity overseas.
  
  Variations of beer
  
  Because the alcohol laws in Japan dictate that beer be taxed according to its malt content, other beer-like drinks have been created by the Japanese brewers that contain less malt and thus are cheaper to sell. The current three ranks of beer are as follows:
  
  Beer
  
  Regular beer with regular malt content. Because of higher taxation, it costs more than the two ranks below. 
  
  Happoshu
  
  Happoshu (lit. ""sparkling alcohol"", also known as low-malt beer) is a relatively recent invention by Japanese brewing companies. It has a similar flavor and alcohol content as beer, but it is made with less malt, which gives it a different, lighter taste. Due to the lower malt content, happoshu is taxed differently than beer and costs less. 
  
  New Genre (Shin Janru)
  
  New genre beer (also known as ""third beer"" or ""daisan no bīru"") is the most recent development in the Japanese beer industry. In order to counter tax changes that reclassified the malt content of beer and subsequently raised the price of happoshu, this beer-like beverage contains no malt, instead using pea, soy or wheat spirits. As a result, it can be sold at an even lower price. 
  
  Over the coming years, the alcohol tax rate will be incrementally adjusted to be unified into a single one for all beer and beer-like beverages by 2026. This means that the price difference between beer and its less-malt-containing alternatives will narrow.
  
  Craft beer
  
  The craft beer (地ビール, ji-bīru, literally ""local beer"") scene emerged in the mid-1990s. Up until then, stringent brewing laws granted licenses only to large-scale brewers. This all changed in 1994 when the government drastically relaxed the law, enabling small-scale breweries to thrive. Since then, craft beer has become increasingly popular, with hundreds of microbreweries around the country now selling high-quality regional beer domestically and abroad.
  
  There is a particularly vibrant craft beer scene in the big cities like Tokyo and Osaka, where various dedicated bars sell beer from a particular brewery they are linked to, if not from a selection of breweries. There are also an increasing number of brewpubs that brew and sell their own beer on premises. Many onsen towns also contribute to the national craft beer presence with celebrated local breweries that take advantage of local pure waters. - Beer in Japan

However, flip-top bottles (I assume you mean the ones with the rubber seal) are produced in both CO2-rated and cheap un-rated beverage bottles - found in supermarkets.

The temperature of fermentation is exceedingly important for the final beer.  Too low (&lt; 15C) can cause the ale yeast to go dormant, stalling the process.  While a high temperature (> 25C) can cause a rapid ferment, where the yeast creates excess esters and fusel alcohols.

Yeast also generate their own warmth during fermentation.  A commonly cited value is that the ferment is around 3C above ambient temperatures.

There are exceptions to this of course.  Some beers (""Saison"" for example) are fermented much warmer.

  In India, the retail industry has bloomed a lot in the last ten years, from selling clothes to eyewear, anything and everything can be bought online. But, there is one question that troubles a lot of people especially the youngsters, Can you purchase your drinks online?
  
  The short answer is YES, you can buy and sell alcohol online. But, in order to sell it online, you need to seek permissions from the state government and ensure that your business model complies with the state laws. You also require permissions to buy/sell liquor in public places. Every state has different age restrictions regarding hard drinks, hence selling or buying drinks depends on the age restrictions.
  
  Prohibition is incorporated in the Constitution of India among the directive principles of state policy which means that legislative powers of alcohol consumption are under the power of respective states. Recently, Bihar had prohibited the sale and consumption of country liquor in April 2016. The Liquor online business model is a risky model but it can be done if you comply with state laws you can run a successful business.
  
  Here are few online alcohol vendors, who are running a successful online Alcohol portal:
  
  Madhuloka is probably one of the most famous outlets for ordering alcohol online. Based in Bangalore, Madhuloka has a wide range of drinks including premium brands as well. The vision of Madhuloka is to provide their guests with best and widest range of wine and spirits. They operate only in Bangalore. 
  
  Madhuloka Wine Boutique is about wines to drink – not just wines that impress at tastings. We particularly emphasize drinkability and try to offer wines, which do not just impress on first taste but leave you wanting another glass.

Wikipedia has this to say about the term ""online"":


  In computer technology and telecommunications, online indicates a state of connectivity, and offline indicates a disconnected state. In modern terminology this usually refers to an Internet connection, but (especially when expressed ""on line"" or ""on the line"") could refer to any piece of equipment or functional unit that is connected to a larger system. Being online means that the equipment or subsystem is connected, or that it is ready for use.
  
  ""Online"" has come to describe activities performed on and data available on the Internet, for example: ""online identity"", ""online predator"", ""online gambling"", ""online shopping"", ""online banking"", and ""online learning"". Similar meaning is also given by the prefixes ""cyber"" and ""e"", as in the words ""cyberspace"", ""cybercrime"", ""email"", and ""ecommerce"". In contrast, ""offline"" can refer to either computing activities performed while disconnected from the Internet, or alternatives to Internet activities (such as shopping in brick-and-mortar stores). The term ""offline"" is sometimes used interchangeably with the acronym ""IRL"", meaning ""in real life"".

The Snow Grouse was already mentioned and is supposed to be served straight from the freezer.

Dalwhinnie Winter's Gold is another one.

And very recently, Johnny Walker launched the White Walker (base on the Game of Thrones show).

A couple of remarks.
The Dalwhinnie expression is the only single malt among the named three. The others are blends of malt and other grains.
Any ""other"" whisky, I personally, would never drink chilled. Neither chilled with ice nor with stones. To explain why, just a little background. Some whisky's are ""unchillfiltered"" or ""non chill filtered"". If so, it says so on the bottle. These whisky's still contain lots of essential oils. Chilling them will cause these oils to coagulate and form a hazy draft in your dram. Not what I want.
With this in mind, using ice is bad because it will water down your drink on top of chilling it. Using stones is almost equally bad, because though your drink will not be diluted, it will still turn for the ugly.

So I would keep drinking whisky at room temp, and if you don't appreciate it now, you'll learn... If you still want a cold one, take one of the three mentioned, as they were purposely invented to this end.

7528,2,,2018-10-23T11:36:23.267,1,,"What are tannins in wine?


  Tannins refer to the diverse group of chemical compounds in wine that can affect the color, aging ability and texture of the wine. While tannins cannot be smelled or tasted, they can be perceived during wine tasting by the tactile drying sensation and sense of bitterness that they can leave in the mouth. This is due to the tendency of tannins to react with proteins, such as the ones found in saliva. In food and wine pairing, foods that are high in proteins (such as red meat) are often paired with tannic wines to minimize the astringency of tannins. However, many wine drinkers find the perception of tannins to be a positive trait—especially as it relates to mouth feel. The management of tannins in the winemaking process is a key component in the resulting quality.
  
  Tannins are found in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be introduced to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization &lt;8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier[18] and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as ""hydrolysable tannins"" being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.
  
  In the vineyards, there is also a growing distinction being made between ""ripe"" and ""unripe"" tannins present in the grape. This ""physiological ripeness"", which is roughly determined by tasting the grapes off the vines, is being used along with sugar levels as a determination of when to harvest. The idea is that ""riper"" tannins will taste softer but still impart some of the texture components found favorable in wine. In winemaking, the amount of the time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins, stems and seeds will influence the amount of tannins that are present in the wine with wines subjected to longer maceration period having more tannin extract. Following harvest, stems are normally picked out and discarded prior to fermentation but some winemakers may intentionally leave in a few stems for varieties low in tannins (like Pinot noir) in order to increase the tannic extract in the wine. If there is an excess in the amount of tannins in the wine, winemakers can use various fining agents like albumin, casein and gelatin that can bind to tannins molecule and precipitate them out as sediments. As a wine ages, tannins will form long polymerized chains which come across to a taster as ""softer"" and less tannic. This process can be accelerated by exposing the wine to oxygen, which oxidize tannins to quinone-like compounds that are polymerization-prone. The winemaking technique of micro-oxygenation and decanting wine use oxygen to partially mimic the effect of aging on tannins
  
  A study in wine production and consumption has shown that tannins, in the form of proanthocyanidins, have a beneficial effect on vascular health. The study showed that tannins suppressed production of the peptide responsible for hardening arteries. To support their findings, the study also points out that wines from the regions of southwest France and Sardinia are particularly rich in proanthocyanidins, and that these regions also produce populations with longer life spans.
  
  Reactions of tannins with the phenolic compound anthocyanidins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influences the color of red wine. - Phenolic content in wine

Go to a place like Germany and their beer may be served at room temperature.

One overall benefit of storing any liquor in the freezer would be making it smoother on the way down -- it eases any burn on the throat. This can apply to just about any liquor, though some types of liquor have noticeable differences in taste when served warm vs cold. A couple that come to mind are:


Cognac (specifically Salagnac)
Deep Eddy Lemonade
Fireball


During the Hennessy shortage of 2017, many customers at our store had to look for alternatives. Those who didn't go for Remy Martin went for Salagnac. When cold, Salagnac has a very similar taste to Hennessy. When warm however, this isn't as much the case.

Both Deep Eddy Lemonade and Fireball have stronger, sweeter flavors at room temperature. When cold, the sweetness isn't as much of a smack in the face, and with fireball the flames seem to more along the lines of a smolder.

You do not put bourbon or scotch in the freezer. Both are intended to be straight or on the rocks. It doesn't make the liquor go bad in any way, but is seen as heresy and you may be shunned by friends or family. There is a noticeable difference in the taste notes of smoke and oak, so it's best to leave these ones out.

The following may be helpful in drinking rum: 


  Most spirits are distilled to 40 percent alcohol by volume, or 80 proof, but many rums are bottled at higher proofs. For those stiffer rums, “adding ice or a splash of water will mellow it out so the alcohol vapors don't overpower the subtle flavors,” says Vida. His rule of thumb: “I'd say 45 percent [ABV] or lower you should drink it neat, but anything above that you may enjoy more with dilution.” - The 5 Most Useful Rules for Drinking Rum

7535,2,,2018-10-26T11:57:57.620,2,,"Does it make sense to store hard liquor in the freezer?

The short answer is: It depends on the liquor and the individual.


  Here’s the thing, sticking any spirit in the freezer has its benefits. As the temperature drops, the viscosity (thickness) of a liquid increases. That means after vodka hangs out in the freezer for awhile it has a better texture. According to Claire Smith of Belvedere, “[vodka] becomes more viscous, richer. It coats the mouth.” The same can be said for any spirit (or liquid, really). However, with that viscosity comes a tradeoff: the muting of flavors and aromas.
  
  As a spirit gets warmer, it releases more volatiles, compounds that easily vaporize. We know that if a spirit is too hot, the smell of pure alcohol can be overwhelming (see: why we put ice in our whiskey). However. when a spirit is too cold, the aromas and tastes might seem downright non-existent.
  
  Now for vodka, this isn’t a huge deal, because in general vodka has less flavor and odor than whiskey. We’ll just say it: vodka is less complex than whiskey. It has less impurities. That doesn’t mean vodka is bad. Hey, it reportedly gives you less of a hangover than whiskey. However, to the average person, if you lose some vodka flavor, well, you’re not losing much. However, much of enjoying a dram of whiskey is taking in the nose (the same goes for wine, which is why we also don’t recommend freezing it). 
  
  Says Kevin Liu, Chief Cocktail Maker at The Tin Pan, “There are comparatively fewer volatiles in vodka, while the whole point of aging whiskey is to create desirable volatiles.” He adds, “[The whiskey doesn’t lose any volatiles, [they’re] just harder to detect when you have cold whiskey. Putting [whiskey] in the freezer and then taking it out will have no effect at all.” In general, spirits that have hung out in a barrel longer will have more depth than vodka, so it’s best to keep them out of the freezer.

7536,2,,2018-10-27T04:49:54.587,3,,"Ice in any spirit is always about personal preference. Adding ice does two things to any spirit, regardless of category:


It lowers the temperature, slowing down evaporation of the ethanol, making the spirit more pleasant to smell and softer on the palate. 
It dilutes the spirit, again softening the effect of the ethanol on your palate. Some people will opt for a few drops of water instead of ice in order to get the dilution, but more stable (as the ice melts, the dilution increases) as well as not dropping the temperature too low for the nose to really come through. 


Ultimately, this is about preference. Try a rum neat. Then try it with a few drops of water. Try it with ice. Which way did you prefer? Drink it like that. 

You'll find that different rums (and different styles of rum) will suit you more with ice, with water, or neat. And those preferences will change over time. When I was tasting new rums for reviews multiple times a week, I became more tolerant of the bitterness of the alcohol and found I was drinking heavier, harsher rums neat more often. These days I'm more likely to add water or even ice on a hot day. 

Drink what makes you happy (unless it's Captain Morgan).

What does happen a lot in the rum industry is the post distillation addition of rum, as referenced in Eric's answer (the author at Alcademics - Camper English - has done a lot of research on sugar in rums). 

Sugar can have gluten contamination if it is produced near grain processing. Depending on the rum and where the producer sources their sugar, if sugar is added, there is a slight chance of this happening. 

If you want to avoid any chance of additive sugar, you can target brands that don't use additive sugar like Foursquare from Barbados or any Rhum Agricole from Martinique (additive sugar is illegal for rums produced with the AOC from Martinique).

  A fumarium was a smoke chamber used in Ancient Rome to enhance the flavor of wine through artificially ""aging"" the wine. Amphorae were placed in the chamber, which was built on top of a heated hearth, in order to impart a smoky flavor in the wine that also seemed to sharpen the acidity. The wine would sometimes come out of the fumarium with a paler color. In his book Vintage: The Story of Wine, Hugh Johnson noted that Pliny the Elder and Columella did not recommend that ""first-growth wines"" like Falernian, Caecuban, and Alban be smoked.
  
  For preservation, the amphorae were sometimes treated with sulphur dioxide prior to being placed in the fumarium. In his book, The Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature, John Kitto states that the ban on smoked wines as offerings in the Mishna stemmed from the Roman use of sulphur fumes-a uniquely Gentile technique.

For sparklers, chilling keeps bubbles fine rather than frothy. This is also a good range for white dessert wines; sweetness is accentuated at warmer temperatures, so chilling them preserves their balance without quashing their vibrant aromas.
  
  Full-bodied white wines and light, fruity reds: Serve at 50°F (10°C) to 60°F (15°C) to pick up more of the complexity and aromatics of a rich Chardonnay or to make a fruity Beaujolais more refreshing.
  
  Full-bodied red wines and Ports: Serve at 60°F (16°C) to 65°F (18°C) — cooler than most room temperatures and warmer than ideal cellaring temperatures—to make the tannins in powerful Cabernet or Syrah feel more supple and de-emphasize bitter components. - How to Serve Wine 101: Tips on the Perfect Serving Temperature

Its my observation that whisky prices after a certain point in quality are more directly based on rarity. It just happens that older whisky, due to the economics of aging and the angel's share, is always rarer. 

For no age statement(NaS) whiskys the pros and cons can be summarised as follows, most of the pros apply to the distillery only, but some
Pros:


distilleries can sell product sooner, and thus deal with things like
surging demand (e.g. Suntory in Japan for an extreme) or startup
costs (NaS whiskys are very common in new distilleries).
customers may not be put off by seeing a very young age on the bottle that may not be representative of the quality, there are plenty of decent young whiskys out there.
distillers gain more flexibility in blending casks to achieve a desired flavour profile.
a shorter time to market for experiments/new products (cheaper experimentation). This can be a plus for customers too if they like variety.


Cons:


Many are younger, often leading them having a slightly harsher
alcohol flavour, and less complexity. It is unlikely to be terribly
bad though, as the distilleries still have a brand to maintain.
Selling stock earlier means less available for older bottlings later on. How much of a problem this is may depend on storage space and production volumes to begin with.

7559,2,,2018-11-07T17:41:52.980,8,,"Here is my take on serving wine at a variety of temperatures and colors after years and years of serving wine and drinking it. 

Remember storing wine and serving wine are two different things. All wine should be stored in a cool dark spot, preferably on it's side if it has a cork at around 50F degrees. 

Most people keep their white wine in the fridge at around 37F which is slightly too cool but you know what, but the time you open the bottle and put it in a glass it will quickly warm up to the perfect temperature. I usually keep white wine with one of those freezer bottle coolers thingies to keep it cool. The lighter the bodied the cooler you can go. I am not a fan of warm Chardonnay. Age worthy wines like Chardonnay and Riesling can stand to be slightly warmer but in reality they will warm up in your glass quickly. More aromatics are released as they warm up.

Rose' wines for the most part should be served at the lower end of the white wine range. 

The thing most people don't know is that light red wines like pinot noir and Beaujolais should be served at cellar temperature. Last time I was in Paris (France) I was surprised at how cold they served their red wines. Really almost all of them at refrigerator temperatures. I mostly put all my red wines in the fridge an hour or so before serving unless I already have them at cellar temperature (50ish degrees).

Highly tannic red wines actually benefit from being cool. The perception of the rough bitter tannins is reduced by cooler temperatures. 

Full bodied dessert wines, like Tokay, should also be served at a temperature slightly above cellar temperatures. Most are highly aromatic and you want a little be more warmth to release those aromatics.

In general, try to cool off your wines before serving. White wines more so than red but all wines should be served cooler than room temperature.

Almost all grapes can be made into sweet wine by one of these methods, but not all of them are as tasty as others. Some grapes, like Riesling, can make both an excellent sweet dessert style wine and a dry wine. Then others like Cabernet Sauvignon are rarely made into sweet wine. It has to do with the tannins. The one exception to this is Port and Madeira where they make sweet wines from red grapes but these are meant to age.

So, to answer your question. No, sweet wines don't have to be related to a specific grape, but they are for taste purposes and not on the physical properties of the grapes.

Edit: Another important technique to have sweeter wine is to dry grapes. Incidentally, the Amarone/Recioto couple is a typical examples for both sweet and dry wines from the same grape.

7579,2,,2018-11-28T13:49:58.047,2,,"Why is red wine often paired with red meat?

The old wine pairing phrase goes as thus: “red with red meat and white with fish”. But wine pairing is generally a little more complicated than that.

Here is how Dr. Vinifera puts it:


  The reason red wine typically pairs well with red meat is that red wine tends to be higher in tannins. While on their own, tannins can feel drying, they’re a good complement to the rich fattiness that can be found in red meat. White wine can be better with fish or chicken because it tends to have higher acidity, and it complements food similarly to how a squirt of lemon juice can brighten a seafood dish.
  
  But those are just general rules. If you look at how a dish is prepared—say, grilled vs. poached, or sautéed in a bunch of butter, or take into account the side dishes or the setting, you might come up with different pairings based on the situation. So while a chewy grilled steak might call for a robust red, a sautéed filet mignon served with béchamel sauce and rosemary potatoes might work better with a rich, full-bodied white. - Why is white meat served with white wine and red meat with red?

What's happening is that the wine is oxidizing, and the flavor and aroma compounds are being destroyed once they're exposed to a significant amount of air.   While temperature does make a different, the larger factor here is the amount of surface area to volume, which is quite high in the glass compared to in the bottle.  While a bottle in the fridge will keep it's flavor components intact a bit longer than if it were on the counter (and longer yet if you put it in the freezer) a bottle on the counter will still retain its character longer than a glass in the fridge, or certainly on the table.    

Another factor to consider is how well aged and tannic the wine is.  All red wine is not made alike, and a young tannic wine will hold up better for longer (and indeed even improve for awhile before it starts to degrade) compared to a wine that's well aged and already at or past its peak.   

In any case, you're probably looking at a matter of hours.  While I've never paid close attention, I would guess that depending on the wine, an average of somewhere between 6 and 12 hours is going to be the limit before you start to see noticeable degradation.  It could be more or could be less, but not by an order of magnitude.

7593,2,,2018-12-13T20:22:56.163,5,,"What is the official way to drink a Boilermaker?

First of all there are two types of boilermakers.


  A boilermaker can refer to two types of beer cocktail. In American terminology, the drink consists of a glass of beer and a shot of whiskey.1 The beer is either served as a chaser or mixed with the whiskey. When the beer is served as a chaser, the drink is often called simply a shot and a beer. In Philadelphia, it is commonly referred to as a Citywide Special. In Texas, it is known as a Two-Step. In parts of Florida, it is often referred to as a Git-Right. 


Apparently there are also two ways to drink a Boilermaker. Neither one is official or wrong. It is up to the individual's choice.


  There’s a large debate concerning how the boilermaker is supposed to be consumed. While the shot and beer combo might seem straightforward, there are actually several different methods for drinking it, and each one is readily accepted as the best way by those who do it – the only thing that most people agree on is that the shot must be whiskey.
  
  The first method is your most basic, and the purists would have you believe it’s the classic: you drink the entire shot and then chase it with the beer. It’s that simple. However, as more high-end cocktail bars have also embraced the boilermaker, and thought more about the pairing of whiskey and beer, drinkers have taken to going back and forth between the two drinks, taking a sip of the shot and then a gulp of the beer, until each drink is finished.
  
  But the most exciting way to drink a boilermaker has to be how it often goes down in London – a practice that is gaining popularity in the States as well – dropping the shot directly into the beer. A modification of this is pouring the shot into a beer can or bottle. Fans of this method say it’s the best way to see how the beer and whiskey interplay. Plus, who doesn’t love the sound of a shot glass full of whiskey dunking into a cold glass of beer? - The History Of The Boilermaker – Otherwise Known As A Shot And A Beer


The most traditional way to drink a boilermaker is as follows: The liquor is drunk in a single gulp and is then ""chased"" by the beer, which is sipped. Although no official way of drinking it exists The most traditional way would, in my mind, be more closer to an official manner of drinking it. 

Here how the boilermaker possibly got its' name:


  Stories are murky at best as to how the boilermaker first came into existence, but it’s pretty clear that the drink was originally consumed by blue collar workers at the end of a long shift – which is why it’s now become the shift drink of choice among bartenders. It’s believed the drink takes its name from the workers who built and maintained steam locomotives in the 1800s. These workers were known to head to the bar at the end of the shift, and a shot of whiskey with a beer became a staple for quickly easing the pain that came from a hard day of back-breaking labor. As it was the drink consumed by boilermakers, it took on the name as well. - The History Of The Boilermaker

In Europe in the ye olden days, there was no separation between where someone grew the grapes and what the wine was called, ie Burgundy, Chianti, Bordeaux, Rioja. In most of these regions, these grapes were selected over generations of growers to work perfectly in those regions. 

Later on, maybe about 100 years ago, people started naming their wines similar names to these well known regions. Champagne is the classic example and probably the first to assert it's region name (aka appellation) around the world. Calling something Champagne in California did not make it Champagne. Champagne only comes from the Champagne region of France not Napa Valley in California. 

It was intrinsically known what would grow where in Europe and mostly people didn't fiddle with it. Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grew well in Burgundy and that's pretty much all they grew. Then along came the New World. Mostly after WWII, growing regions all over the world started growing grapes and didn't have the history that many of these old European regions had and they wanted to tell people what was in the bottle so the rise of grape names came into being. 

In Europe they created governing bodies to protect their appellations and making laws about how and what people could grow grapes. Protecting place names became a big deal. Now it's spread to many other things like tea, cheese, tomatoes (San Marzano), etc. 

In the new world, they have the freedom to pretty much grow whatever they want, how they want and wherever they can so an emphasis on cute names and grape names is emphasis and places where grapes are grown are de-emphasized (OK, there are excepts like Napa Valley and Barossa Valley) As new world areas really figure out what is best grown in their regions you will see more emphasis on regional names and less on grapes.

First ""Fox Grapes"" are American grapes. There are several species of vitis that are used for wine production. I think in this case it's vitis labrusca. 

So, here's what happened. Somewhere in the 1860s a French researcher brought grapevines from the USA to France in pots with soil. He planted them in a vineyard to study them. What he didn't know is that he brought two problems back with him, powdery mildew and phylloxera. 

Phylloxera is a root louse you can barely see it with the naked eye. American grapes, having been exposed to this bug for millions of years, adapted to this bug and is now resistant (resistant to powdery mildew too). European grapes, all which are one species vitis vinifera, had no resistance to this bug. So, in a few short years it decimated almost all European grapes. 

Researchers were desperate to figure out a way to combat this bug. There was a three pronged approach. First they poisoned the soil and that works but is bad for the soil. It literally kills everything in the soil. Bugs, animals, fungus. Most of which is beneficial. This was eventually outlawed in the Europe. 

Another way was to graft american rootstock to European grapes. This is the way almost all grapes in Europe are grown now. The third way was to breed American vines and European vines. This was quite popular too since it eliminated the hassle of grafting rootstock.

These newly bred vines were called ""hybrids"". (BTW, Isabella was not one of these newly bred grapes. They think it was a chance encounter between European grapes and American grapes in the USA as people tried to plant European grapes in the USA). Anyway, back to the hybrids. Many, many new varieties of grapes were produced and with careful breeding they could make decent wine but never quite as good as 100% vinifera.

The French, leading the charge, banned all non-French grapes from being grown in France as an act of purity. They force untold acres of grapes to be dug up and replaced with pure French grapes. This spread to other parts of the EU several decades ago and now very rare to find these old hybrids being grown.

There are new efforts at using advanced breeding techniques to breed grapes that are almost indistinguishable from 100% but have hybrid features to combat phylloxera and powdery mildew and reduce the amount of chemical sprayed in the vineyard. Hybrids are still quite popular in the USA for these reasons and also they are quite cold tolerant and can withstand much colder temperatures than what is typically found in Europe.

Cold stabilizing is putting the wine in a freezer at about 25 degrees for a couple of weeks. I usually do this naturally on the coldest days of the year. Tartaric acid turns into tartrate crystals and sink to the bottom. Also, you can add Potassium Bicarbonate and it reacts with tartaric acid and reduces it. You'll have to do some research here.

As for scotch:


  From a gluten-free standpoint, scotch is safe to drink for most of the celiac population. Even though whiskeys are commonly derived from barley, a gluten-containing grain, they are distilled alcohols, which means the gluten proteins have been removed to less than the proposed FDA standard of 20 parts per million.   
  
  There is always the potential that the distillation process doesn't completely remove the gluten. If you are ultra-sensitive, then it may be prudent to avoid scotch, but most celiacs tolerate distilled alcohols just fine.

The key trick going on here is that years of aging have been standardized with respect to interactions with the barrel they are aging in.  While time is certainly important when it comes to aging whiskey, much more important is contact with the barrel.  As shown here, conversions are done based on the internal surface area to volume ratio of the containers used to age the whiskey.  A greater surface-area-to-volume ratio means more rapid interaction between the whiskey and the barrel and therefore faster acquisition of the flavors desired from aging (though the different parameters will almost certainly yield at least subtly different results).

It is important to note, however, that this is a trade-off.  Yes, you can age whiskey faster using smaller/higher-ratio barrels but you'd need many more to make the same amount of whiskey.  So for a smaller producer who wants to match their demand as best they can, using small barrels can be a good way to sell longer aged whiskey more quickly and in more manageable quantities.  On the other hand, for a larger producer who expects to have a large demand down the road, full-size barrels are likely a better option.

So ultimately, this is more a matter of the fact that ""years"" of aging has an implicit ""in standard size barrels"" as a part of it, we just don't generally think of it that way.

But like all plastics, long term storage is not a good idea since plastics are permeable and allow gasses to pass through. Maybe the plastic they use to make syringes is some super plastic but I kind of doubt it.

Your plan to suck some wine out (through the cork?) with a syringe is not without merit and you can buy contraptions that do this, but the big thing you will run into is that you need to replace the wine with some type of gas or eventually gas will leak around the cork because you created a vacuum, and spoiling your wine. You would need a way to inject nitrogen into the bottle as you are sucking out the wine.

Freezing wine is always a bad idea.

2) Alcohol content. Taxes may depend on ABV (for minimum rate of excise duty on beer in the EU, see here). The higher is the ABV, the higher is the tax. 

3) Marketing. The beer is a very special one, and it is easier for Dogfish to find consumers willing to pay more for such a special beer.

Back to the tradition piece, France and many other European countries have laws and a legal designation system applied to their products. You may have seen them: Appecation d’Origine Controlee (AOC), Vin de Pays, Vin Ordinaire, etc. 

All of those factors play into whether you can get the coveted AOC, which requires strict traditionalism. You can sell your wine for a lot more with that designation. More experimental things will get you a lower tier certification.

Newer/non-EU wine-making areas (Australia, New Zealand, Chile, USA) have no such laws, and are free to experiment.

From blind taste tests with representatives from 3 major distilling groups in Scotland, at 3 years, my whisky had the look and feel, and taste, of an 8-10 year old whisky.

The progression from raw spirit was very rapid after year 1, taking on colour very quickly. And from the year 2 check (obviously a very young whisky, although pleasant) to 3 years it fully developed.

To me as a hobbyist, the cost was cheap (cask and duty were the most expensive elements) but for a distillery the profit margins would not be high. The Angel's Share loss is high - I wouldn't want to age mine for 12 years, for example.

Interestingly, Scottish distillers have as an industry moved well away from age specifiers as they can make much higher profit on branded flavours. There are still prestige or premium age whiskies, but that accounts for a much smaller volume. They aren't, aside from some very small distillers, using small barrels. Remember, if they wanted to capitalise on age, this still wouldn't help them as they'd have to report the age correctly.

St. Basil (January 1st, 2nd and 30th) 


And now for some innovations in the world of liturgical mixology. We created the Great Basil in honor of St. Basil the Great, a fourth-century Greek Father and Doctor of the Church. Ingredients for this crisp summer drink include muddled basil and white Lillet wine, both in honor of the herbs and “vapid wine” that were a part of the abstemious saint’s daily diet.

1 lime wedge
1 tsp. simple syrup
3-6 fresh basil leaves
2 oz. Lillet Blanc
1 oz. gin basil sprig (for garnishing)

Squeeze lime into shaker. Add basil leaves and simple syrup, and muddle gently. Add ice, Lillet, and gin and shake vigorously at least forty times. Pour into an old-fashioned glass filled with ice. Garnish with a sprig of basil.


The Consecrated Life (February 2 [Feast of the Purification])


St. Bruno and St. Benedict are among those saints who took the spiritual life very serious and wrote the rules that still exist for their respective Religious Orders (Carthusians and Benedictines). This fine nuanced drink is very suitable for a selected few occasions such as an ordination (priest or permanent deacon) and on the anniversary of one’s ordination. It is also an open idea to help celebrate the Feast of the Purification which is the liturgical end day of the holy season of Christmas and the World Day of Consecrated Life (February 2) as was promulgated by Pope St. John Paul II on January 1, 1997. The Consecrated Life consists 1 oz Bénédictine; 1 oz Yellow Chartreuse and 4 oz Ginger Ale. Serve Cold.


Leap Year Cocktail (Leap Year’s New Year’s Day and February 29)


The Savoy Cocktail Book touts the Leap Year Cocktail for having “been responsible for more proposals than any other cocktail that has ever been mixed.” Invented by the books author, Harry Craddock, for the Leap Year celebrations at the Savoy Hotel, London, on February 29th, 1928, the cocktail is certainly substantial enough for any celebration. Substantial enough for any celebration.

Ingredients:

2 oz Hendrick’s Gin
1/2 oz Grand Marnier
1/2 oz sweet vermouth
1/8 oz lemon juice

Shake with ice. Strain into a cocktail coupe. Garnish with a lemon twist.


St. Tropez (April 29)


St. Tropez is a posh town on the French Riviera named after its most famous deceased inhabitant, St .Tropez of Pisa (d. 65), an attendant of the Emperor Nero who was converted by St. Paul and subsequently decapitated. According to legend, his headless body was placed in a boat which drifted to the current location of the town.

There are a couple of different cocktails named after his final resting place; the one we include here uses red Dubonnet, a wine made especially for mixed drinks.

2 oz. Dubonnet
2 oz. orange or cranberry juice

Build in an old fashioned glass filled with crushed ice and stir until cold. 


The St. Damien (May 10 (USA), April 15th (Hawaii))



  St. Damien de Veuster, SS.CC., better known as Damien of Molokai, was a heroic priest who served the leper colony on the Hawaiian island of Molokai until he himself succumbed to the disease. Our St. Damien cocktail is a sweet and tangy tropical drink that includes pineapple juice for the saint’s adopted home, lemon juice for the bitterness of leprosy, and grenadine made from pomegranate, a symbol of self-giving. He died April 15th, 1889.


1 oz. gin
¾ oz. pineapple juice
¼ oz. grenadine
¼ oz. lemon juice
1 splash soda water (optional)

Pour all ingredients except soda water into a shake with ice and shake forty times. Strain into a cocktail glass and top with a splash of soda water.


St. Augustine (August 28)



  This brilliant saint (along with his iconic mom, St. Monica) was born in what is modern-day Algeria. Famously known for being a party boy — “Lord make me chaste, but not yet!” — he eventually changed his ways and became one of the most well-known Christian philosophers and theologians in history.
  
  This cocktail is loosely based off of Mazagran, a drink that became a staple in Algeria many centuries after St. Augustine walked around as the bishop of Hippo, but we think that the patron saint of brewers would probably enjoy it, regardless. 


1 oz of simple syrup
 2 oz of cold brew coffee
 2 oz of stout beer
 2 oz of rum
 1/2 oz of heavy cream (or half and half) 

Mix together the coffee, beer, rum, and simple syrup. Add ice, and pour the heavy cream (or half and half) on top. 


St. Mother Teresa (September 4)



  St. Mother Teresa inspired millions — from presidents and royalty to the poorest of the poor. She was a bold, small woman who wasn’t known to mince words. Inspired by her simplicity, as well as her roots in both Albania and India, we’ve developed an apt cocktail to honor this formidable, simple woman:


2 oz of simple syrup
 2 oz of freshly-squeezed lemon juice (keep a slice of the lemon for garnish)
 1 oz Raki (an Albanian spirit — but you can use brandy if you can’t find it)
 1 oz of sparkling water
 1 tbsp of mint 

Mix all together, muddle the mint, and add ice! 


St. Michael’s Sword (September 29)



  According to an Irish legend, blackberries are bitter after Michaelmas (September 29) because it was on that day that Michael cast Lucifer out of Heaven, and that when he did, the Devil landed on a blackberry bush, spitting on it and cursing it. The St. Michael’s Sword is made from blackberry brandy and Jim Beam Devil’s Cut Bourbon. The “Angels’ share” is the portion of the whiskey that escapes into the air during distillation, but the “Devil’s cut” is the portion that seeps into the wood of the barrels. Jim Beam claims to have stolen this cut back from the Devil, and so we gratefully offer this portion to St. Michael for a job well done.


1½ oz. Jim Beam Devil’s Cut bourbon 
¾ oz. blackberry brandy
2 dashes orange bitters
1 cherry for garnish

Pour all ingredients except cherry in a shaker with ice and shake forty times. Strain into a cocktail glass. Use a cocktail spear (St. Michael’s sword) to transfix the cherry (the Devil, red with shame and rage).


St. Pope John Paul II (October 22)


Known for his simple ways and his brilliance (the man spoke at least six languages fluently — and many more not-quite-fluently) St. Pope John Paul II wasn’t just a genius but an inspiring leader whose words about living a life boldly without fear still propel both young and old into action today. “Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth,” he wrote, “and God has placed in the human heart a desire to know the truth — in a word, to know Himself.”     

As the first Polish Pope — and the first non-Italian pope in 400 years — we think a simple drink tasting like a homey apple pie is something this warm, Polish playwright would enjoy:  

1.5 oz of Polish chamomile-infused vodka, like Zubrowka Apple cider 

Mix — and you’re done. Add ice if you’re feeling a bit fancy; heat up if you’re feeling cold.


The Beast of Revelation (Halloween, October 31 or All Soul's Day November 2)


This is my own creation for setting an allhallowtide atmosphere.

The book of Revelation tells of a star named Wormwood that plummets to Earth and carries with it bitterness that poisons a third of all of the earth's waters on The Day of the Lord.

This cocktail is a different way to celebrate All Soul’s Day, saints associated with exorcisms and shall we say Halloween. The black Absinthe Gothica has a starring role in this drink as it also recalls the demon Wormwood in The Screwtape Letters of C. S. Lewis. Blackberry wine reminds us of the blackberry legend with St. Michael and the Devil. The Beast of Revelation is made as follows: 1 oz Absinthe Gothica (any other absinthe will do); 4 oz of blackberry wine; and 1oz rye, whiskey or vodka (optional).  Be aware that Absinthe Gothica is “Strong as hell, this stuff is evil!""


Cristo Rey (November 23)


A here is a drink to honour the memory of Blessed Miguel Pro, Mexican Jesuit and martyr who died on November 23, 1927. Before the firing squad was ordered to shoot, Fr. Pro raised his arms in imitation of Christ and shouted the defiant cry of the Cristeros, ""Viva Cristo Rey!"" – ""Long live Christ the King!” When the initial shots of the  firing squad failed to kill him, a soldier shot him at point-blank range. He is also the first martyr to be photographed at the moment of being killed.

3 measures of Tequila (blue agave)
1 of Mezcal
½ meas. of St. Germain (elderflower liquor)
½ of lime juice
Splash of Pierre Ferrand Dry Orange Cointreau
Dash orange bitter


St. Francis Xavier (December 3)


St. Francis Xavier was a prolific missionary from Spain covered a lot of territory and converted a lot of souls in his mere 46 years, especially when the only mode of transportation to cross oceans was a wooden ship. Known as the “Apostle of the Indies” and the “Apostle of Japan,” he went to India, Southeast Asia, Japan, and China. We think he inspires a pretty global drink, so we suggest marrying sangria with sake. We hope this converts you and all your friends:

8 oz of sake
1 bottle of merlot
6 oz of orange juice
2 oz of lime juice
2 oz of lemon juice
4 oz of cherry (or pomegranate) juice
1 cup of sparkling water
Orange, lemon, or lime (or all) slices 

Combine everything together and serve immediately!


Tom and Jerry (Christmas (December 25 and Christmastide)



  A Tom and Jerry is a traditional Christmastime cocktail in the United States, devised by British journalist Pierce Egan in the 1820s. It is a variant of eggnog with brandy and rum added and served hot, usually in a mug or a bowl. 
  
  The drink's name is a reference to Egan's book, Life in London, or The Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn Esq. and his Elegant Friend Corinthian Tom (1821), and the subsequent stage play Tom and Jerry, or Life in London (also 1821). To publicize the book and the play, Egan introduced a variation of eggnog by adding 1⁄2 US fluid ounce (15 ml) of brandy, calling it a ""Tom and Jerry"". The additional fortification helped popularize the drink. - Tom and Jerry (drink)



Holy Water Cocktail (Baptisms) 


The Holy Water Cocktail is a cocktail in the making for visitors to the home when no one saint’s day or feast comes to mind at the moment. It is one’s ferial cocktail, for those stand by moments to express our faith. It also fine to serve on days when water comes to mind within the liturgy such as the Baptism of the Lord. The Holy Water cocktail is one of the most beautiful blue cocktails out there. This stunning, fruity mixed drink combines vodka, rum, blue curacao, Peach Schnapps, lemonade, and a splash of pineapple juice, and it’s guaranteed to blow people’s minds especially if you serve it in a big goblet filled with cruched ice. The Holy water cocktail consists of 1 oz. (30ml) Vodka; 1 oz. (30ml) Rum; 1/2 oz. (15ml) Blue curaçao; 1/2 oz. (15ml) Peach Schnapps; 4 oz. (120ml) Lemonade; Splash Pineapple Juice. Fill the glass with sprite (or 7 Up). 

Remember that drinking is always to be done responsibly.

7650,2,,2019-03-04T14:36:48.423,3,,"I'm assuming you want to say, ""Who are the first people to domesticate grape vines?"". Grapevines are not ""bushes"" they are technically vines. In the wild they grow up the side of trees in a forest and try to reach their leaves above those of the trees and also grow their fruit high so the birds can eat berries and scatter the seeds.

Wild grape vines have 2 sexes but domesticated vines are hermaphroditic, which means they are self fertile (both sexes in the same flower) which makes it so much incredibly easier for the vines to produce fruit. It was a game changer when humans found these vines. Instead of only female plants producing fruit, now all vines produced fruit and lots of it. At the same time humans realize you could easily propagate vines by taking cuttings from a mother vine and they would produce the same exact vine over and over (a form of cloning). 

There is evidence that suggests that humans had domesticated grape vines almost 10,000 years ago. It probably started with some people growing vines up trees deliberately and then switching to a trellis system to simulate trees. There are pictures in the ancient Egyptian tombs showing grapes being trained and harvested on a trellis system. So they were pruning them way back then. Later on, if you walked through a vineyard near ancient Rome, it wouldn't look too much different from vineyards you see anywhere in the world. So, we have been growing vines essentially the same way for at least 2000 years.

Another thing noted by this article is that carbonated alcoholic beverages (e.g., beer) cause the body to absorb alcohol more quickly; therefore, if you were to consume beer before liquor, your body would have even less time to deal with the alcohol absorption than the other way around.

7660,2,,2019-03-14T00:14:03.103,7,,"Why are wine bottle volumes in centiliters not in liters or milliliters?

Part of the answer is in the marketing system used in a particular country or region and part of it would be about the size of bottle being purchased.

In Canada and the USA, in a standard bottle of wine, there are 750 millilitres (ml), 75 centilitres (cl) or 0.75 litres (l). Wine bottles aren't quite litre-size, but the average wine bottle will contain 750ml of wine. 

I see only 750ml bottles in the area where I live. I am fine with that. A bottle of wine marketed as 0.75 liters seems less appealing than wine sold in a bottle marketed as 750ml. And one marketed with a 75cl label seems less traditional in this neck of the world and may not sell as good as one sold with 750ml marked on the label. It is sold in a more positive light so to speak. It is all marketing.

I am sure there are other reasons, but take a look at Difford's Guide to mandatory bottle sizes around the world. It is an eye opener to say the least.

However there is more to the Subject:


  When glass bottles become popular though, it is surprising to see that both continental Europe and Great Britain had glass containers of a similar size. The British had an official glass-container size of a fifth of their Imperial (UK) Gallon at around 900ml, while other Europeans' bottles gravitated around 700ml to 800ml. The US officially adopted the 750ml bottle as a standard in 1979, as a metric equivalent to the fifth of a US Gallon (757ml). - Standard Bottle


Alcohol measurement in bottles has undergone several revisions in the last few decades as Difford's Guide point out for the USA mandatory spirits bottle sizes (January 1, 1980) and the European Union mandatory spirits bottle sizes (January 1, 1990).

A drink or two a day is quite fine to drink providing there is no history of proven alcohol dependency or some other underlining medical problem such as diabetes.

A drink or two per day is not a habit, but could become habit forming if it becomes a daily necessity by which an individual can not live without.

While living in France, the families I know had one or two glasses of wine with their meals with no ill effects. Some were even in the medical profession!

People have different opinions on how many drinks one may safely have per day. Even then there may be some risk.


  How Much Alcohol Is Too Much? 
  
  According to extensive research by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), less than 2 percent of drinkers who fall within the following guidelines ever develop alcohol use disorders.
  
  Men: Four or Fewer Drinks Per Day 
  
  For men, low-risk alcohol consumption is considered drinking four or fewer standard drinks on any single day and less than 14 drinks during in a given week. According to the NIAAA, to remain low-risk, both the daily and weekly guidelines must be met. 
  
  In other words, if you are a man and you drink only four standard drinks per day, but you drink four every day, you are drinking 28 drinks per week. That is twice the recommended level for low-risk alcohol consumption. Likewise, drinking four drinks a day four times a week would also exceed the guidelines.
  
  Women: Three or Fewer Drinks Per Day
  
  Research has shown that women develop alcohol problems at lower levels of consumption than men. Therefore, the guidelines for low-risk drinking are lower for women. The NIAAA guidelines are three or fewer standard drinks a day and no more than seven drinks per week.
  
  Again, both the daily and weekly standards must be met to remain in the low-risk category. If you drink only two drinks a day but drink them every day, that is 14 drinks a week, or twice the recommended amount for low-risk consumption.

Alcohol: Balancing Risks and Benefits


Drinking should always be done in moderation. Alcoholic drinks drank in such conditions would not impair one's health or brain. That say one who is has very little body weight should be aware that having a drink could make them legally drunk more quickly. This  could possibly hamper one's skills while impaired.


  Experts believe that drinking does not actually lead to brain cell death. In fact, researchers have found that moderate drinking can have a number of health benefits, including improved cognitive abilities and lowered cholesterol levels.
  
  One study that involved comparing the number of neurons found in the brains of alcoholics and non-alcoholics found that there was no difference in neocortical neurons between the two groups.
  
  Even heavy binge drinking and long-term alcohol abuse don't actually result in the death of brain cells. Instead, alcohol damages the dendrites located in the cerebellum and reduces the communication between neurons. Researchers discovered that alcohol use not only disrupts communication between neurons; it can also alter their structure. One thing it does not do, they found, is kill off cells.

To sum up my research - the answer remains somewhat inconclusive, as is the case with many questions in diet science.

The problem is that researchers can't easily isolate the effects of alcohol from other lifestyle choices, which are many and varied. For instance: sure you can find 1000 people who drink once per day, but the other food/drink they consume, their age, gender, genetics, level of exercise, job etc etc etc all vary wildly. 

What this means is that it's impossible to give a definitive answer using scientific research.

But I can tell you this

Alcohol is a toxin, it's not meant to be consumed by humans, and in fact we have physiological mechanisms (read: our liver) to deal with such toxins entering our body.

On the plus side, if you only have one drink per day and don't mix it with other medications that cause liver damage, for the most part you should be fine. The body was built with an ability to metabolize and excrete such substances fairly tidily.

But make no mistake, alcohol is a toxin and there is no conclusive evidence that it confers any type of long-term health benefit, and I may even go as far as saying that 1 drink/day would be harmful to longevity. I say this simply because the body was built to treat it like a toxin, and not a nutrient. By definition a toxin can only harm us.

In all likelihood complete abstinence is the healthiest option. You'll get by, and still live a long life if you drink regularly, but in theory there should be a physiological cost. The question for anyone is whether the benefit of drinking is worth that cost.

On what basis do you know that? If you've done some prior research on the topic, it really ought to be mentioned in your question, so that we all start on the same page.
From the comments on your question, I infer that you're talking about leaf pulling, not &quot;pruning&quot; per se. (Or if you are talking about some particular kind of pruning, please please edit your question to say so! Don't just argue in the comments — edit your question until it reflects the thing you actually mean to say!)

Leaf pulling is done just after flowering, when fruit set is complete so you won’t disturb the pollination process.  In the southern hemisphere, it is round about middle to end November and in the northern hemisphere in May (off course this may vary from climate to climate).
Leaf pulling will improve cosmetic quality by minimizing the bruising of the grape skin from leaves scratching its surface.  For wine and table grapes, it will improve the overall grape and wine quality, as the vines are using the nutrients available more efficiently. ... [It] will allow the vines to dry off much quicker after rain or heavy dew and thus will make the vines less susceptible to the spread of fungal diseases.

These benefits all seem like things a viticulturist would notice pretty quickly — say, within 10 or 20 years of their first exposure to any fungal disease, i.e., within 10 or 20 years of the invention of viticulture, which as farmersteve says, goes back some 10,000 years. So we should expect to see the invention of leaf-pulling some 9,980 years ago. :)
Indeed, leaf-pulling is explicitly mentioned in Cato's De Agricultura:

Ubi vinea frondere coeperit, pampinato. Vineas novellas alligato crebro,  p50 ne caules praefringantur, et quae iam in perticam ibit, eius pampinos teneros alligato leviter corrigitoque, uti recte spectent. Ubi uva varia fieri coeperit, vites subligato, pampinato uvasque expellito, circum capita sarito.
When the vine begins to form leaves, thin them. Tie up the young vines at frequent intervals to keep the stems from breaking, and when they begin to climb the props tie the tender branches loosely, and turn them so that they will grow vertically. When the grapes begin to turn, tie up the vines, strip the leaves so as to expose the grapes, and dig around the stocks.

Cato's De Agricultura was written circa 160 B.C., by which point viticulture had been around for millennia. The Greeks also had several words for artificial trellises and stakes used to train grapevines — e.g. the χάρακας &quot;vine-props&quot; of Aristophanes' Acharnians circa 425 B.C.

There's reason to think maybe the Greeks might not have practiced leaf-pulling as much as the Romans: leaf-pulling reduces fungal rot and increases light to the fruit-bearing part of the vine, but also increases the risk of sun damage in sunny climes. Rome's latitude is 42°N; Athens' is 38°N. And just to complicate matters, the latitude of the 6000-year-old Areni-1 winery in Armenia is 40°N — right in the middle! So I won't hazard a guess as to whether the Greeks or the Armenians practiced leaf-pulling; but we do know that Cato wrote about it.

To summarize:

Viticulture probably goes back some 10,000 years
Industrial viticulture dates to 4000 B.C. (Areni-1) or older
Vine training probably goes back at least that far
Leaf-pulling probably goes back at least that far
A specific technical vocabulary for vine training dates to 425 B.C. or older
Technical documentation of leaf-pulling dates to 160 B.C. or older

They say it contains the ""cut of the devil"", which basically is the whisky, that is soaked inside of the barrel, after it was emptied.

  The original Citrus version: orange, lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, lime - Five Alive (Wikipedia)

  The “Five” represents the five fruit flavors in the drink. There has been a total of seven varieties, but the original was a blend of orange, lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, and lime. I have no idea what this combination tastes like; I’ve never had Five Alive. The memory I have of this product is entirely visual, etched into my psyche from a passing glance in a grocery store some 22 years ago.
  
  While relatively popular in the U.K. today, Five Alive’s accessibility in the United States is limited. How it fell into reticence is anyone’s guess. - Juicy Details (Five Alive)




Five Alive Varieties 

You can always use the modern Five Alive drink or Grenadine if you want. The one quarter cup in the recipe could be for either a syrup or a juice. A syrup would definitely make it more sweeter.

Amaretto


County of origin: Italy (Saronno, Italy)
Alcohol by Volume: 28%
Flavor: Slight bitter almond
""Flavoured from bitter almonds, various modern commercial brands are prepared from a base of apricot stones, peach stones, or almonds, all of which are natural sources of the benzaldehyde that provides the principal almond-like flavour of the liqueur."" - Amaretto (Wikipedia)
Etymology: ""The name amaretto originated as a diminutive of the Italian word amaro, meaning ""bitter"", which references the distinctive flavour lent by the mandorla amara or by the drupe kernel. However, the bitterness of amaretto tends to be mild, and sweeteners (and sometimes sweet almonds) enhance the flavour in the final products. Thus one can interpret the liqueur's name as a description of the taste as ""a little bitter"". - Amaretto (Wikipedia)




Bottles of Amaretto Liqueur

Crème de Noyaux


Country of origin: France
Alcohol by Volume: 40%
Color: Pink or Clear (Bols is red)
Flavor: Almond
""Crème de Noyaux (pronounced is an almond-flavored crème liqueur, although it is actually made from apricot kernels or the kernels of peach or cherry pits, which provide an almond-like flavor. Both Bols and Hiram Walker produce artificially colored red versions of the liqueur (either of which contribute the pink hue to Pink Squirrel cocktails) while Noyau de Poissy from France is available in both clear (blanc) and barrel-aged amber (ambre) versions."" - Crème de Noyaux (Wikipedia)

Here, a glass of good house craft beer is not more expensive than a commercial pint in my hometown and foodies are also very good quality. The view over Marina Bay is even better than the beer.

One of the twenty regions of Italy, and one of the most northern, is Trentino-Alto Adige. It borders with Austria and, for some 20km, with Switzerland. Trentino-Alto Adige is divided in two provinces: province of Trento (Trentino, capital town Trento) and province of Bolzano/Bozen (Alto Adige/Südtirol, capital town Bolzano/Bozen). The latter is more northern than the former and is the proper bilingual area on that side (German and Italian are the two most spoken languages). Bolzano/Bozen is the most populated city council in its province and, curiously, the one with the highest rate of native Italian speakers. Unfortunately I can't reference this statistic that I heard in the years I was used to visit those places often.

Roughly speaking, the German or Austrian influence on culture and food and drinks is positively evident all around the region, becoming milder moving north to south.

Several Austrian and German beers are popular here: Stiegl, Spaten, Maisel's and many more. The interesting point about beers, but not unexpected: beverages from several foreigner brands and companies are distributed but also produced in Italy. While I was searching for the linked reference, that seems to agree, I was sure to remember that Weihenstephan, one of my favourite beers back to those mountains, was produced and bottled either in Germany or in Italy at the Forst brewery in Lagundo, in Alto Adige/Südtirol.

7733,2,,2019-05-14T12:02:44.133,2,,"Why is alcohol so expensive in Australia?

It is mostly due to taxation. But not all of it is.


  The World Health Organisation’s latest Global Alcohol Report put Australia in the second-highest band of alcohol consumption: total per capita consumption is between 10 and 12.4 litres of pure alcohol a year.
  
  According to the Australian Hotels Association, around 20 per cent of the cost of beer at the pub is made up of tax.
  
  INCOHERENT SYSTEM
  
  Regardless of whether you think we pay too much or too little, Australia’s current alcohol taxation system is, put simply, a complete mess.
  
  It’s a hodge podge cobbled together over 30 years of deals, dodges and industry favours.
  
  Case in point: commercially produced beer today is taxed at no fewer than eight different rates, depending on a range of factors including alcohol volume and the type of packaging.
  
  Meanwhile, wine is taxed not on alcohol content but sales value, meaning the cheaper the wine, the less it is taxed.
  
  At the moment, there are broadly three different federal taxes that apply to alcohol:
  
  • Excise, indexed twice annually in line with the Consumer Price Index
  
  • The Wine Equalisation Tax (WET), which is based on sales value
  
  • Customs duties — a combination of alcohol content and sales value
  
  There is also the flat 10 per cent GST on all retail alcohol sales.
  
  The automatic indexation was introduced by the Hawke Government 30 years ago as a way of avoiding negative headlines every budget.
  
  At current taxation levels, drinkers pay 45c for every 1 standard drink in a full-strength beer. For spirits, which are taxed the highest, it’s an extra $1 per standard drink — a mark it hit for the first time this August. - Why do we pay so much for alcohol?


To this one can add the production price, distribution prices, markup prices at alcohol outlet stores and import costs when applicable (transportation and import duties).

Remember that after fermentation your beer contains alcohol which has lower density than water.


Hydrometer 
You can measure specific gravity of your wort and your finished beer using the hydrometer. There are calculators avaliable online to tell you how much alcohol your beer has. You just enter OG and FG into calculator and it will give you estimated ABV. There is no need to adjust for alcohol density using hydrometer.
Refractometer
You can buy a refractometer and measure specific gravity (SG) of your wort pre and post fermentation. Pre-fermantation reading is going to be an accurate one (for example, if you see 1.050 then you write down 1.050). With refractometer you need to adjust for alcohol density. Or you can use an online calculator that does it for you:
https://www.brewersfriend.com/refractometer-calculator/
You just enter OG and FG as you see it on your refractometer and it will give you Adjusted FG and estimated ABV.
Pycnometer
This is the method I prefer (altough few people use it) because it is the most precise measurement tool that you can have at home. You need a pycnometer and an accurate scale (better accuracy, better measurements -> 0.1 gram accuracy should be more than enough). What you do is you calibrate your pycnometer. Fill it with distilled water at X Celsius (usually it is 20C but you can choose different temperature -> choose one that is close to your usual wort pitching temp) up to a marked level in the pycnometer and measure the weight. Then, at the same temperature you weight your wort which will allow you to determine the exact amount of sugar in the wort. You do the same with the fermented beer. After that you have your OG and FG estimated by pycnometer instead of refractometer and can use the same calculator for estimated ABV. Pycnometer is just more accurate then refractometer but requires more work.

Fermentation (aging) is very important for both wine and liquor alike, and the oak barrels are used because they provide extra flavor. In the case of wine, and specifically red wine, the oak brings out the spice and tannins that many people are looking for.


  Oak wine barrels have been used for centuries in the fermentation and aging processes of wine by wine crafters. Aging wine in oak wine barrels provides the wine with aromas that would typically be found on your spice rack – nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, vanilla and clove to name a few. And as it passes over your tongue, hints of caramel, mocha, butter and toffee are just a few that come forward.


Oak Wine Barrels or Stainless Steel Wine Drums?


  ... a liquid stored in oak will experience some degree of evaporation. This natural process contributes to the concentration of the wine (much like the way chefs “reduce” a sauce on the stovetop to intensify it) with respect to both aroma and flavor


To add in addition to the article, a new trend among (American) wineries is aging the wine in barrels that previously held liquor. This means that the barrels have absorbed the flavor of the liquor held in it previously, and add extra flavor to the wine as it ages in the reused barrel. Some popular combinations would be:


Cabernet Sauvignon/Zinfandel/Red Blend aged in Bourbon/Whiskey barrels
Chardonnay aged in Rum barrels


Notice how red wines are more so aged in old whiskey/bourbon barrels, as the wineries are looking to add more spice notes (sharper notes on the tongue) whereas the chardonnay (white wine) is aged in a rum barrel to get more of an oak note with a slight fruitiness to it.

Old bourbon/whiskey barrels will have sharper, stronger notes (more spice than oak) whereas the rum barrels have more mild, sweeter notes (lots of oak with a hint sweetness from the rum)

7745,2,,2019-05-16T12:13:08.130,1,,"What are the disadvantages of storing and transporting wine in steel barrels?

Well there that stainless steel wine drums are durable, impart no external flavours to the Wine, are easier to clean and are more green (no need to use oak trees to make barrels).


  First of all, stainless steel wine drums are durable. They can be used over and over, year after year. The life of an oak barrel is between two and three years, depending on many factors. This means that oak trees must be harvested regularly, stripping our forests. And wine is highly acidic, and that acid tends to corrode the wood over time. So it makes economic sense for wineries to replace oak barrels with stainless steel. This economic advantage is important to winemakers because wineries use large quantities of barrels and using steel barrels allows them to reduce costs.
  
  And using steel barrels provides another advantage as well. They impart no flavor into the wine, so they are perfect for experimenting with exact flavors. With oak barrels it is difficult to control the wine’s exposure to air, and this exposure can alter the flavor of the wine dramatically. Steel barrels allow much more control over flavors.
  
  And there is one more factor to consider. Stainless steel barrels are much easier to clean than oak barrels. They have a very smooth surface inside, so cleaning them takes almost no time. Oak barrels tend to get scratched on the inside, and the wine seeps into those scratches and lingers long after the wine is removed. And this means that the flavor of the next wine to be stored in that barrel will be influenced by the remnants of the wine that was aged in that barrel previously. And this can interfere with both the flavor and the quality of the wine. And when you use steel barrels there are no woodnotes present, and the finish is crisp, fresh and light and the wine becomes more fruit forward (which is what many people prefer.)
  
  When all is said and done, every wine, whether aged in oak or stainless steel, has its own elite group of followers. And for the consumer it is a win-win situation because they have the option of enjoying wines created by both processes, depending on their mood. Wine created through both methods are easy to enjoy and appreciate. - The Great Debate – Oak Wine Barrels or Stainless Steel Wine Drums?


Thus if your after that added oak flavour, stainless steel drums are not the best.


  Aging wine in oak wine barrels provides the wine with aromas that would typically be found on your spice rack – nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, vanilla and clove to name a few. And as it passes over your tongue, hints of caramel, mocha, butter and toffee are just a few that come forward. - The Great Debate – Oak Wine Barrels or Stainless Steel Wine Drums?


The following can not be achieved in Stainless steel Drums:


  Wood (and specifically oak) is a fundamentally porous material by nature, and that means a liquid stored in oak will experience some degree of evaporation. This natural process contributes to the concentration of the wine (much like the way chefs “reduce” a sauce on the stovetop to intensify it) with respect to both aroma and flavor. And then there are even more factors, such as where the trees were grown and how the wood was dried. All of these variables contribute to the results with fuller and richer complexity and impressions that can only be achieved with fermenting and aging wine in oak barrels. - The Great Debate – Oak Wine Barrels or Stainless Steel Wine Drums?


Aging wine in barrels may be better for some wines:


  Depending on the type of wine, aging isn’t a factor. Particular white wines don’t age well and shouldn’t be stored in oak barrels. Red wines that contain various hints of spice, on the other hand, are usually aged for sometimes years at a time in oak barrels. - Oak vs. Stainless Steel Barrels, Which One’s Better? 


One of the wineries near here (British Columbia) uses both (oak barrels and stainless steel drums) in their wine making. They incorporate a small of berries (blackberries, raspberries etc.) into the process of their wines in order the enhance the taste of the wine. The number of their stainless drums far outnumbers the their oak barrels.

By the 1970's Ireland only had two distilleries, Midleton which made Jameson among other things, and Bushmills.

2) If I can't use bentonite, then can I use gelatin instead? I had a horrible batch  last time I tried to use gelatin. I guess I had put too much and it won't fully sediment.  I had to throw the batch away, as it basically turned into 5 liter jello shot lol. How much (by weight/teaspoon) gelatin should I add for 5 liters of beer?

The Vikings did not have microscopes, likewise neither did the Germains who wrote the beer purity law of 1516 which does not include yeast as in ingredient. Brewers (often clergy or women called ""brewives"") believed it was a mystical process and kept beer consistent by saving sediment in patties or cakes for the next batch like bakers save chunks of dough. The term yeast may have been used before pasteur but he surely changed the meanining and revolutionized standardized beers by isolating yeast types.  As far as I know beers that rely on wild yeasts are the ""farmhouse"" styles compared to the main two; lager and ale yeasts.

First thing I would do is get a cheap cooler, not the styrofoam cooler that you might get from a gas-station but, an double-wall insulated plastic one. The way that you pack it will make a big difference in how long it stays cold. 

If you can, bring the cooler down to temperature by sticking some ice in it a day before your trip. For the trip, use the biggest ice that you can, small ice melts faster. You can fill big plastic juice bottles with water and freeze them. You also want to fill as much of the cooler as you can, so fill in smaller spaces with smaller ice. Put a folded-towel inside of the cooler, on top of everything else, to prevent too much cold air from escaping when you open your cooler. The towel should take up the entire surface-area of the cooler and when you grab a beer, only lift as much of the towel as necessary. Avoid opening the cooler more than you have to, so grab everyone a fresh beer at the same time. Of course, try to keep your cooler in the shade.

Without ice, you could take a note from the botijo. A botijo is a ceramic jug, called different things but, used around the world as a water jug. The ceramic is porous so it 'sweats'. And just like a with a person, when the 'sweat' evaporates it cools the container down. I wouldn't put beer in it, it'd go flat and it'd be hard to clean. But you could get a growler, keep it wet, and aim a portable fan at it. I don't know how well it'd work but, it's worth a shot. If the beer doesn't stay cold, at least the fan will cool you off.

Concrete fermentation and storage tanks started becoming popular in California around 2013, but they've been around forever. It's easy to cast it into different shapes which can create movement of the liquid in the tank, changing the mouthfeel of the wine. This happens becuase there is sediment at the bottom of a wine tank, the movement lifts the sedement and increases the wine's interaction with it. Concrete can also 'breathe', allowing oxygen to interact with the wine. These things can help to improve the quality of the wine. When you put wine in a steel barrel, that's it... the wine is done evolving.

Honestly, concrete also looks nicer. There's a fairly large tourist industry around wine. Steel tanks at a vinyard aren't as beautiful or interesting to tourists as wood or these big concrete eggs. That supposed lack of beauty changes the customers perception of the product, which makes a difference in how they enjoy and talk about the wine. There are disadvantages to concrete of course, amongst other things it's difficult to clean and it's heavy. I'm not saying that concrete is better than steel, it's just different. But, the reason that some people use it over steel, or in conjunction with steel, should point to supposed disadvantages of steel.

That will depend on on several issues.
First of all some beers may be better served at warmer temperatures than other beers.

Depends on the beer really. A good rule of thumb is darker beer should be served at a warmer temperature than lighter beer.
For instance if you refrigerate all of your beers and then pull them out of the fridge and drink them instantly you will miss A LOT of the flavor complexity of pretty much every stout and porter you put to your lips.
But, if you let the dark stuff warm up for just 15 minutes before you drink it (let it sit at room temp) a bunch of new flavors will appear that you never would have noticed otherwise.
This doesn't work so well, in my experience, for lighter beers like pilsner, lager, or hefe-weisen. They really are meant to be drank cold and letting them get warm changes their flavor profile for the worse.
Obviously there will always be personal preferences but, at a minimum I encourage you to try letting your darker beers warm up just a bit and see what a positive difference it makes. - What temperature should I serve my beer?

Another possible idea is that if you are near water you can get a Floating Cooler For River or Pool. They range from 6 cans to 72 cans.

Intex Mega Chill II Inflatable Floating Cooler, 48&quot; X 38&quot; holds 72 cans.
Then of coarse there is the traditional cooler method. The larger the cooler and the more ice there is in it will keep your beer warmer.
There is also a Coleman Thermo-electric 12V Ice Chest which may serve your purpose. This what I when I go camping. No ice is recommended. You have to pre-cool the cooler at home and then plug it into the outlet in car or truck. keep the chest plugged into your vehicle the whole trip to your destination. One fall back to this system is that you can not leave plugged into your vehicle more than 3 hours without the car or truck running. But then you can either take an additional cooler or floater with you.

Coleman 40 Quart Power Chill Thermo-electric Cooler is what I use and it works great. Use it with darker beers and give it a try. Do not open it every 5 minutes and recharge it in the car every so often. It works like a charm.
If you are lucky there may be a cold natural spring near by to place your beer into.

  wine in “imperial gallon”. One gallon is about 4.546 liters.

  gallons, about 225 liters. A real nightmare for conversion! So to ease
  the calculation, the wine makers from Bordeaux decided that 1 barrel
  would be 300 bottles of wine instead of 225.

7785,2,,2019-06-26T23:54:18.763,5,,"How can I layer liquors on top of each other?
The key to creating perfectly layered drinks is to pay attention to how heavy each ingredient is compared to the other ingredients. The weight of each liquid is measured by its specific gravity.
An alcohol density chart can be viewed here.

There are a few simple rules to follow:

You want to use a narrow glass to maximize the thickness of each layer without using a ton of booze. There actually is a specific pousse-café glass, but only your crazy aunt has those, and do you really want to go over there and borrow one? No. Just use a champagne flute or a skinny shot glass.

The order in which you pour is the most important aspect. You want to start with the liquid that has the greatest specific gravity, and decrease as you ascend. That way they liquids won't try to pass through each other, which will mostly likely just end in blending. Terrible stupid blending! Start with the sweetest, least-alcoholic liquid, and go up from there until you have the least-sweet, most-alcoholic liquid at the top.

Pouring technique is critically important. This definitely takes a steady hand. If you pour too fast, the top layer will plunge down into the one under it, which will cause mixing. That ain't pretty, and prettiness is what this drink is all about (prettiness and science). The top of a bar spoon is pretty much the ideal tool, but you can pour over the back of a regular spoon, too. Just position the spoon right above the last layer, and pour as slowly as humanly possible. This is why bartenders hate you for ordering these.  How to make a multi-layered drink



Here are a few Tips for layering drinks:


To keep the layering effect, the drink should not be stirred.

A chilled glass often works best. Also, if your drink does not include ice, it's best to chill the ingredients before pouring.

A speed pourer can be helpful for slowing down the pour as well. This is particularly true if your liquor bottle is full and heavy.

Some bartenders will put the tip of the spoon just under the first layer, which helps the liquid stay on top. Depending on your technique, this may help you as well.

Layering can also be done with a syringe that is food-safe. It's not as professional (or cool) looking, but it is easier. Be sure to choose one with a larger hole. - How to Create Layered Cocktails and Shots




Use the back of a spoon to help you create your layered drink.
For those who desire to look more professional in this domain, one could employ a Rainbow Cocktail Layering Tool


An ingenious piece of equipment, the Rainbow Cocktail Layering Tool allows anyone to start making their own layered cocktails. Using a clever float that sits on your drink as you make it, you can easily pour one drink on top of another without the layers mixing!

Above all, please pour your liquors and liqueurs very carefully and slow.

7786,2,,2019-06-27T04:57:31.017,1,,"For fermenting with bread yeast most sources cite an average yeast alcohol tolerance of 13-14% AbV.  Obviously bread yeasts vary between manufacturers.  

There are numerous other factors influencing attenuation, some common ones are:


concentration of sugars in the juice / must / wort
amount of yeast used
fermentation temperature


If your intention is to make quality wine, then it would be best to purchase a small amount of a purpose-bred wine making yeast, and grow it up into an amount large enough to ferment a batch.  Before pitching the yeast into the wine, reserve a small amount to grow up for the next-batch.  This method requires the least cost, but still ensures the yeast-type is appropriate for the beverage.

If you are making a ""country wine"" (fermented fruit juices, ginger ""beer"", flower-flavoured water+sugar, etc.) then bread yeast will be OK, but you would need to experiment to get the pitch correct.  For a rough idea, on a beverage that would ferment out to ~14% I would start with 40 grams* of dry bakers yeast into a 20 litre batch.

I strongly advise you to purchase a hydrometer so it's possible to monitor the performance of the fermentation.  Do this by taking a reading before pitching the yeast, and during fermentation.


My reasoning on this is the original gravity to produce this amount of alcohol would be quite high, say 1.1 SG / 23 Brix.  If this were beer, a pitch rate like this would be in order, and was verified with a pitch-rate calculator online.

The short answer is yes.

Here are five examples from around the world:


  5 Smoky World Whiskies Challenging Scotch
  
  When the topic of smoky whisky comes up in a bar it’s usually in association with Scotland, and more so, the famed isle of Islay. From Lagavulin to Bowmore, Islay enjoys a long, rich history of peated (smoky) whisky-making, made possible through the island’s vast peat bogs, where the organic matter has been accumulating for centuries. Used throughout time on the isle, not only for whisky-making but as a source of fuel, peat and the whisky born through it is now synonymous with Islay. But the whiskey world is changing and peated expressions, bursting with notes of earth, wood, and smoke, are being created in countries you’d never imagine. From the land of the rising sun all the way to the Pacific Northwest, here are the smoky whiskies challenging peated Scotch on the global whiskey stage.
  
  Westland Peated Single Malt
  
  Based in Seattle, Westland has been a leading force in the recent movement of American single malt whiskey. The distillery utilizes a carefully thought-out mash bill and uses local ingredients to create a range of stellar single malts. The team also launched the Garryana-matured Native Oak series, which sees Westland travel across the West Coast in search of Garry oak, a rare type of wood native to the Pacific Northwest. Further expanding their portfolio, Westland Peated claims to have a ‘mash of peated malt that is among the smokiest in the world.’ The smoky malt is mixed with their unpeated variety to create a balanced whiskey bursting with notes of campfire wood, smoke, subtle fruit, and vanilla, present through maturation in American oak.
  
  Mackmyra Svensk Rok
  
  Sweden is known for many things. Good coffee, cinnamon buns, sustainability. They’re also making a mark on the whisky world. Mackmyra started in 1999 and has since launched successfully in markets all over the world. They keep it local too, as all the ingredients used in production are sourced within 75 miles of the distillery. The Mackmyra Svensk Rok is made using Swedish peat from a white moss peat bog (Karin-mossen) in the region of Gästrikland. The release also features the addition of Swedish juniper, with twigs placed on top of the peat stacks before burning. Speaking to Angela D’Orazio, Mackmyra’s master blender, she emphasizes that juniper makes up only 1% of the smoking material. As juniper’s profile is so strong, this percentage is enough. The nose brings fruit, vanilla, juniper, and subtle smoke. Aromas of raisins and plums continue on to the palate, where the smoke intensifies. Earth, wood, and soft juniper in the air deliver the whisky of Sweden.
  
  Paul John Peated Select Cask
  
  Based in Goa, India, the Paul John distillery is one of the pioneering forces behind the Indian single malt whisky boom. Alongside Amrut, Paul John creates one of India’s only single malt whiskies, exporting their expressions across Europe, Asia, and the US. Despite the company's huge size, modesty is quickly seen in their ethos. As the master distiller, Michael D’Souza, puts it during our chat, ‘we do not do anything special to create quality single malt whisky, we simply see that each and every whisky-making step is meticulously followed.’ Bottled at 55.5%, the Paul John Peated Select Cask is made using Scottish peat, as India doesn’t have peat bogs. The smoke from the peat fire dries the malt and flavours it, before it’s broken down, fermented, and finally, distilled. Matured in bourbon casks and distilled using six-row barley, the nose is sweet and surprisingly spicy, with ginger, pepper, and cinnamon aromas. The palate delivers abundant smoke, meatiness, and leather, while the spice turns sweet, bringing about a stellar balance. Colourful, vibrant, and balanced, this Paul John single malt is a must for lovers of peat.
  
  Kavalan Peaty Cask
  
  There’s not much to say about Kavalan that hasn’t already been said, even Paul Giamatti sings the distillery's praises on Showtime's 'Billions' series. The distillery is truly a wonder. In just 11 years the team have managed to create whisky which stands tall against the oldest, most established distilleries in the world. Based just outside Taipei, in Taiwan, the distillery utilizes the country’s hot, humid climate, which greatly accelerates maturation, making Kavalan whiskies burst with deep flavours far beyond their years. While Kavalan doesn’t (yet) make peated spirit in the traditional sense (drying the malt over a peat fire), this expression was matured in a cask previously holding peated whisky. This interesting approach delivers a subtle smokiness, with some pineapple and sandalwood on the nose. The smoke intensifies on the palate as does the presence of summer fruit and caramel, finally delivering a long, rich finish of balanced sweetness and smoke. A truly spectacular smoky expression, partially reminiscent of a traditional peated malt but with the exotic, oriental addition of sweet tropical fruit and incense.
  
  Yoichi 20 Year-Old
  
  Founded by the father of Japanese whisky, Masataka Taketsuru, Hokkaido’s Yoichi distillery has come to be known as the maker of intense, smoky Japanese whisky. Taketsuru dreamt of creating whisky similar to the Scottish, but in his own homeland of Japan. For this reason, he left his job managing Suntory’s Yamazaki distillery after 10 years and started Yoichi (and Nikka) back in 1934. Sadly, the Yoichi aged range was discontinued a few years ago, amidst stock shortages at Nikka. But some bottles of the 10, 15, and 20 Year-Old remain in the 'wild' for those willing to search.
  
  The Yoichi 20 Year-Old is the very definition of peated Japanese whisky. Powerful and bold, yet deep and rich, it all comes together to create this timeless expression. Aromas of deep smoke, umami, and leather blend in with the presence of vanilla and burnt caramel. The palate is unexpectedly lively, with winter spice and dried fruit joining the thick earth, oak, and smoke. Meaty notes with some liquorice bring a well-balanced finish to this truly exceptional whisky from Japan.

7794,2,,2019-07-04T01:36:10.327,6,,"Safety

There is absolutely no need to worry about liquor, including tequila, ever freezing or exploding like a beer or wine would. To freeze liquor, temperatures of -100 to -170 degrees F are required. Your basic house hold freezer is set at about 0 degrees F, and an industrial deep freeze only gets to about -50 F;
It also does not matter what type of Tequila it is, as all tequila will be 40% alcohol by volume.

As far as personal safety, Tequila straight out of the freezer is not cold enough to worry about being harmful to drink as some have suggested; IMHO it is much better than other liquors that are traditionally kept frozen such as Sake.

Taste

Like Sake, Tequila does have a different flavor if kept at room temp vs in the freezer.
When the tequila is chilled, you may find that your mouth isn't bombarded with the chemical compound, ethanol (alcohol),  that can eviscerate your tongue and completely overpower one's olfactory receptors. Without these hindrances, one may taste a sweet nectar flavor not present in a room temperature drink.

I personally enjoy an amaretto over ice, but the idea of doing this with Creme de Noyaux makes me feel a little queasy (in the same way I love a maple syrup but am not going to add vodka and drink that over ice). 

There are probably ways you can change the original recipes slightly to adjust for this difference and are then likely to get a similar flavour :)

7806,2,,2019-07-07T20:50:07.513,3,,"What does the absinthe ritual do?

It is a tradition and it makes the absinthe go cloudy!

It is simply the traditional way of drinking absinthe.


  Absinthe is a distilled highly alcoholic drink. It is 45–74% alcohol by volume / 90–148 U.S. proof) beverage. It is an anise-flavoured spirit got from herbs. The herbs including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium (""grand wormwood""), together with green anise, sweet fennel.
  
  The preparation
  
  Traditionally, absinthe is put into a glass. A sugar cube is then placed in the bowl of a special spoon. Ice-cold water is poured or dripped over the sugar until the drink is diluted. During this process, the parts that are not soluble in water make the liquid cloudy. The resulting milky opalescence is called the louche.




Preparing absinthe the traditional way

Apart from just simply the traditional way of preparing absinthe, it also has the merit of sweetening up a little this mildly bitter drink, as well as making it less strong for those who enjoy it thus.

Serving Absinthe with Water and Sugar


  Mix a simple blend. Add 3 parts ice-cold water to 1 part absinthe. For a single serving, this is roughly 3 ounces of absinthe (or 3 shots) to 1 ounce of absinthe (or 1 shot). For each single serving, stir in 1 teaspoon of sugar.
  
  Alternately, absinthe can be sipped neat if you prefer the undiluted taste. But if so, drink moderately. Keep in mind that absinthe has nearly twice the alcohol content of most other liquors, which is why it is typically watered down.
  
  If you are a fan of sugar, mix a teaspoon with the ice water before pouring. However, if you like your absinthe to be less sweet, skip it, since the louche’s milky cloud is formed not by the addition of sugar, but by chemical reactions between water and absinthe’s ingredients. - How to Make Absinthe Cocktail


My sister-in-law is from the Czech Republic, where the drinking of absinthe is quite popular. We always have it the traditional way, but many do not. Neat is alright too.




  Collection of absinthe spoons. These are special spoons used to hold the sugar cube. Ice-cold water is poured over the sugar to dilute the absinthe. Note the slot on the handle that allows the spoon to rest safely on the brim of the glass. - Absinthe ((Wikipedia)

  The introductory sequence had a subtitle 'France 1791' and showed a number of soldiers digging up a grave.
  
  The narrator spoke; 
  
  
    ""There was a legend that whoever drank from the skull of Nostradamus would inherit his incredible powers. But for 200 years his grave had remained undisturbed because the legend also said that whoever did so, would immediately die. One night, at the height of the French Revolution, three drunken soldiers set out to test the legend.
    
    It was not the skeleton that suddenly sobered the soldiers, but the plaque around its neck, with the date: May 1791, which could only have been placed there at the time of burial in 1566, Nostradamus had predicted, 200 years before, the exact date when his body would be dug up.""

The thing is, for Reasons, I want to do the reverse! I'd like to make a slightly acidic beverage, then raise the pH, so it turns purple in the glass.

I'm familiar with using e.g. bicarb to raise pH in savoury cooking--for caramelizing onions, that sort of thing. But I'm concerned about the flavour effects on an alcoholic drink. Are there any edible ways to raise pH that are flavourless, or would be easily masked by a cocktail?

If there aren't, would an Alka-Seltzer tablet provide the right pH reaction? I'm not a chemistry person at all so I'm not sure if the acid-base reaction would provide colour change as well as the bubbles.

How much does it matter?  To a large extent that depends on what you're looking for.  If you're looking for a wine that's a pure expression of the Napa terroir and the barrels it's aged in, obviously the addition of Mega Purple (or non-Napa grapes, or oak chips, or any other additives that result in the end product the vintner is looking for) will detract from that.  In the case of Mega Purple specifically, it adds a darker coloration but at the expense (to some degree, how much depends on how it's incorporated) of aroma and potentially added sweetness.  

If, on the other hand, you're looking for a bottle of wine that you particularly enjoy, then it doesn't matter at all.  If the color and the aroma and the flavor please your tongue, than to me, that's good wine.

So, if you really enjoy them, I'd suggest going ahead and continuing to enjoy them and don't worry about.  If it still bothers you, find something else you enjoy more, and buy that instead.  That's one of the best things about wine...There are always new amazing options just waiting to be discovered.

There's about 2 liters; in a simple bottle and a home-made airlock.

It's about 35% honey, the rest is bottled water, about half a lemon sliced, and about 1 big teaspoon of Bread yeast.

It did it's thing for about 1 month now; it looks fairly clear, and smells good.

However, it's my first ever attempt at making any kind of alcohol, and without any modern tools.

The absence of sugar could be due to low sugar levels inherent in the substrates chosen for the beer. Or, it could be due to being fermented out. Keep in mind you can ferment things, have their sugar content reduced from the fermentation process, and end up with a beverage with only negligible amounts of alcohol. Think kombucha.

On the other hand sugar can be leftover from the fermentation process because the life form doing the fermentation (bacteria, yeast, etc) stalled before it could consume all the sugar. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast strain typically employed by bakers and brewers, does not like living in high-ethanol environments. That's why it's typically been a challenge for brewers and wine makers to get their alcohol content above the 5-10% range without undesirable components (congeners) being produced as a major side-effect. Alcohol is toxic to yeast!

Whichever way the sugar got there you can be pretty certain it's there for flavour! That could be direct flavouring: sweet things taste nice. It can also be there for balance: sugar ""cancels"" out acidity (and vice versa).

7845,2,,2019-09-11T20:45:08.927,1,,"Unless you used unsafe water or honey, it is safe to drink at any time. The alcohol in the mead effectively keeps it safe for consumption. The fact that it smells good is a good sign and even with some off-flavours everything should be on the safe side. 

Pungent smells, mould and no alcohol at all, however, are signs that something is wrong. 

Generally, fermented drinks are safer than untreated (and possibly contaminated) water because of their alcohol and acid content. That doesn't necessarily mean they are healthier though. 

Depending on the yeast strains involved, the length of the fermentation and what is fermented, fermented drinks may contain substances that make you feel unpleasant (hangover). 

Most fermented drinks are ready to drink once the yeast has settled (and the drink loses its yeasty taste). They continue fermenting albeit at a much slower pace. This means 
their flavour changes over time, usually getting more acidic while losing some or all of their sweetness. In other words, it is ready to drink when it tastes right. 

To prevent further fermentation, you can store your mead in a fridge or a very cool cellar which slows down the yeast significantly.

7846,2,,2019-09-11T22:27:23.220,4,,"You can't. At least not like wine or whisky.

It is different from wine because:
The price increase of wine is based on the vintage. If you a bottle of wine of a high-priced vintage, it increases in market value because over the years the number of available bottles decreases. The value does not increase because it tastes better. The chance of finding a 30 year old bottle of red wine that tastes good are as astronomical as the expenses that come with it. Investing in wine is, as someone put it, speculating in human snobbery.

It is different from whisky different because:
Whisky is basically an infusion of grain alcohol with oak accompanied by a decrease in alcohol. Unlike wine, you will never get an exponential increase by simply storing it longer because the result can be reproduced repeatedly. Whisky, however, does not benefit from bottle-ageing as the alcohol content cannot evaporate and bottles are not made of oak. In other words, unless you plan on opening a distillery, it is unlikely profitable to invest in whisky. Still, even with a highly durable beverage like whisky, there is a tipping point after which its quality starts decreasing. 

Beer is more comparable to blue cheese because:
An aged beer is more expensive than a freshly brewed one simply because it is more expensive to produce. Like blue cheese, it is an acquired taste. To most, it would not even taste like beer. Aged beers suffer from the same short-comings as wine but much sooner as there is still active yeast in it (unless they are as strong as wines of course or you store them at very low temperatures).

Beers that benefit from ageing are usually beers that are not fermented well and have too many off-flavours that they tend to lose after time. That is true for many Belgian beers as they are made with a bunch of wild yeast strains that manifested themselves in the brewing vessels. The taste of hops is completely gone after a few years and the ongoing fermentation eventually converts the remaining sugars into a little more alcohol and --more dominantly-- into acid. 

In order to make a significant amount of money from storing beer, you would probably require a speculative bubble. Otherwise, the increase in value will merely reflect your expenses (ie. the cost of storing it), inflation patters and of course the actual demand.

I should add that speculative bubbles can of course appear at any time anywhere, and the current craft beer craze does in fact somewhat bear resemblance with things like cryptocurrencies though not anywhere near that territory. Such a comparison does, however, hint at the inherent risks involved.

When we make wort, we are creating the perfect conditions for growing yeast (and lots of other microbes). Something will grow in the wort and start fermentation in your barrel.

Bottle bombs are bad - can you imagine a barrel bomb?

I would also question what chemistry you are trying to achieve by aging wort. Compared to the chemical profile following fermentation, wort is relatively simple - it is the yeast during fermentation that makes beer really interesting. If you are looking to add the character of the wood in the barrels (or the prior occupant of the barrel), then this is safer to do following fermentation.

There are lots of examples of using wood/barrels, both new and used, in making some specialty beers. However, I believe that these all use the wood post-fermentation.

Lots of beer styles benefit from some aging. If you age it in something neutral (e.g., glass, plastic, stainless steel), then you are just letting the beer chemistry, with living yeast still present, do its thing. When you age in wood, you are aging as well as imparting additional chemicals from the wood.

Does aging in wood improve the taste of the beer? Some people seem to like it (or we would not see commercial examples), but this is a completely subjective question and really depends on what you are trying to achieve.

Most breweries force carbonate their beer with CO2 in a tank, but many use natural means to do this.

7859,2,,2019-10-10T15:02:16.340,2,,"Fermantation and CO2

Long story short, yeast consumes sugar and produces alcohol and CO2. During primary fermentation all the CO2 is released into the air (unless you ferment under pressure which I assume you don't). After fermentation your beer has alcohol but is flat. You need to introduce CO2 to your product somehow. Since CO2 is a product of fermentation, we add a little bit of sugar into bottles to spark secondary fermentation. Because bottles are capped, at some point when the pressure is high enough inside the bottle, CO2 starts dissolving into beer.

Adding sugar

Adding sugar can be done in couple different ways. You can measure the amount you want, cook it in a little bit of water, mix with your beer and bottle. You can also add a little bit of sugar into each bottle and then fill with beer. I prefer the second method. You can buy muntons carbonation drops and put one drop in each bottle. You can also buy some small measuring cups designed specifically for adding sugar into bottles.

Having a good beer?

Actually - No! I bottled several batches that had off flavors (smelled funny, weren't clear after cold crash, tasted weird, etc.) and the result was good. Beer was ""drinkable"" after a month but then got better. If you are brewing an IPA and it tastes funny don't dump it. Bottle it and see what happens. You might have to wait several months and hop aromas are gonna be gone but you can still end up with some solid beer.

But, it's obvious that SOMETHING happens to whiskey after the bottle has been opened, right? It's the process of aeration - the same process over which so many wine enthusiasts debate. As air passes through, water and alcohol slowly evaporate from the whiskey... thereby leaving behind a stronger concentration of the other substances in the liquor. For very fine whisky, I have been instructed at distilleries to transfer to smaller (airtight) bottles if the opened whisky is to be stored for very long - in order to prevent a change in flavor or potential loss of aroma.

Personally, I can taste a difference in certain bourbons within a couple weeks of being opened (I only intentionally aerate when it's in the glass in front of me in order to get some of the extra aroma out of it.) But, I don't really taste a difference in scotch after the same period (of which I admittedly drink less... unless you're offering ;)

I'd say after a year, it would be difficult to argue that something about the flavor hasn't changed (but that may, again, vary by palate.) However, my whiskey never seems to last that long, be it bourbon, scotch, or rye haha

I hear a lot about the comparisson with how air affects wine. But in wine the effect is very strong and fast. It's within minutes and changes the taste of wine a lot. 

Unfortunately, I never heard of an experiment or more valid sources than just subjective impression.

I'm planning on doing a little experiment myself. I will buy two bottles of 3 or 4 different whiskies, half-empty one of the bottle pairs and compare them after a year (I will exchange the air of the open bottled on regular basis). I'm very curious how big the difference is or if there is any difference at all.

However, this is made under the assumption that any of the liquors you listed will be served straight or neat... If instead the liquors will be served in cocktails, you might actually prefer one of those.

Commonly, a novice drinkers tend to enjoy clear liquor over dark. And, vodka is one liquor in which many very sweet juices, like pineapple, are mixed to make rather delicious cocktails that can even be described as ""light"" and/or ""refreshing."" A lemon drop is sometimes made with simple syrup (basically sugar water) and served with sugar around the rim, much in the same way a margarita (another sweet cocktail made usually made with tequila) is served with salt around the rim.

Each person will perceive tastes a little differently and nothing is full proof in this domain.

Since you are a novice, it may be good to avoid the liquor unless you are using them in some cocktails. In this case, I would go with vodka. 

For the list you site, I would give thought to Coronado Mermaid’s Red Ale. 


  A well balanced, medium-to full bodied beer, red in color and very flavorful. The red color and slight caramel-roasted flavor comes from generous amounts of caramel malts and a touch of chocolate malts. Well hopped to balance the malty sweetness, and dry-hopped with cascade for a full hop flavor and aroma. - Coronado Mermaid's Red Ale


Stella Artois would probably not to your liking. But again, you may enjoy it.

I find some light beer quite sweet, but that is me. 

In order to help you discern what wines are possibly sweeter, I am posting a couple of wine sweetness charts for the benefit of all.


  Red wines have tannin which makes wines taste less sweet than they actually are.
  
  White wines have higher acidity which can make wines taste less sweet. - Wine Sweetness Chart

That will depend on the rum extract being used.

McCormick Rum Extract has 35 percent alcohol. Others have 40 to 45 percent alcohol in them.


  Extracts are about 35% alcohol whereas most liquor is 40%, so you can pretty much substitute one for the other.
  
  Most extracts labeled “pure” are a solution of whatever flavoring component they claim (vanilla, lemon, anise), some pretty strong alcohol (80 – 90 proof), and sometimes a bit of sugar syrup. The chemicals that we recognize as a “taste” are alcohol-soluble, so the easiest way to concentrate them to a baking-ready liquid is to dissolve them out of their skins, seeds, or pods. - extracts vs. alcohol in baking

The short answer is possibly.

The International Beer Challenge Competition and Awards seems to make that claim.


  We are the world's BEST Beer Competition and Awards - as voted by experts - our panel of judges
  
  The aim for the IBC is to reward and promote excellent beers from around the globe providing brewers with a platform to express their beers to trade and consumers.
  
  With the ever growing interest in the beer category, we have set out over 72 different categories to reflect the diversity in brewing today as well as offering traditional beer categories. Over the years we are seeing more and more brewers enter their bottled, canned or mini kegs from round the world and today we receive entries from no fewer than 40 countries.
  
  Being part of the IBC carries a number of significant benefits. It acknowledges the skill of the brewer and is an internationally recognised symbol of quality, frequently displayed on beer labels. Retailers, restaurateurs, bar owners and wholesalers are justifiably proud of the range of award winning beers they carry. Drinks lists promote IBC award-winners directly to the consumer and can influence their buying decision and as a result can increase your brands' profile, prestige and sales.
  
  We have some of the shrewdest beer judges in the land - retailers, importers, publicans, brewers, writers and flavour analysists. The judging process is rigorous, unrivalled and our approach is much respected among our panel of judges.
  
  Winning beers will be presented at the Brewers Awards when we announce the trophy and supreme champion beer, and also crown brewers and retailers who have performed the best across the board in the competition. - The International Beer Challenge Competition and Awards


There is also the World Beer Cup.


  The World Beer Cup is an international beer competition organized by the Brewers Association, a trade group representing America's small and independent craft brewers. It is the largest competition in the beer industry and has been described as ""the Olympics of beer."" According to americancraftbeer.com, ""Winning a World Beer Cup is like winning a Grammy or an Oscar…it brings the world’s attention to even the smallest brewery’s doorstep…and like a hit song or film, it can make a career."" The cup was founded by Association of Brewers president Charlie Papazian in 1996 and is awarded every two years. The competition is held in conjunction with the Craft Brewers Conference &amp; BrewExpo America.
  
  In 2016 there were 6,596 beers from 1,907 breweries from 55 countries. Entries were judged by an international panel of 253 judges from 31 countries. In 2018 there were 8,234 beers entered, a 25% increase over the 2016 cup and the largest field in the competition's history, with competitors from 66 countries. There were 295 judges, three-fourths of them from outside the United States. - World Beer Cup

7934,2,,2020-01-05T01:05:47.987,1,,"wow. ""cold numbs your tongue."" Seems like a very unusual answer to a sensible question.
I can say that each time I try different types of ale or beer I like to read the label for their opinion but most of the time I start with fully chilled and pour some in a glass and let it settle down then take a sip and wait for maybe 5 minutes and try another and so on until I get an opinion of how that particular brew changes and then read their opinion (if one exists) again to see if my experience agrees or to compare what they must be trying to focus on based on their opinion.
Once I figure it out then that is how I drink that brew.
Although I accidentally poured some Chimay Grand Reserve blue label and forgot it one night. When I returned maybe an hour later, it was fairly room temperature.  The amazing thing is that it smelled fruity like a wine and even had a wine like taste.  I use a wide wine glass for my sampling so it captured some of the vapors probably better than a mug or a bottle would have.   I do not always have an hour to wait to let that happen but it was a pleasant surprise.  Usually with the Chimay I let the massive head settle down then take a sip because at cold temp it has one characteristic that I like.  Then I wait for maybe close to 10 minutes and drink some more.  Typically between 10 and 20 minutes is the part I probably like most for general drinking.  Right after it starts warming up from frige temp it begins to seem too much like drinking alcohol.  I can feel and taste the alcohol then it gets a little warmer and begins to take on a sweeter malty flavor.  Then allowed to sit longer it goes into a less attractive taste only to eventually seem like wine after it makes it to another level of warmness.   Sometimes I  pour a 2nd glass after the first reaches a certain flavor and sort of alternate between them to enjoy the different flavors that all came out of the same bottle.

7935,2,,2020-01-07T08:06:16.440,3,,"Dry Martini can sometimes become a very philisophical topic.

As Eric Shain already pointed out, the classic martini consists of gin and vermouth 6:1. You should not forget the water, that is melted while stirring it. This is quite an important part of making a good Martini. You should stirr it for several minutes.

More puristic people go to a ratio of 10:1 or even 15:1. To get to a more extreme combination, you put vermouth into your ice cubes, stirr it for a short while, and then pour the vermouth away, so that only the ice cubes for stirring your gin are thinly layered with vermouth. 

There are even recipes where you would simply put a bottle of gin in the freezer, put vermouth in an atomizer, then pour gin in a frozen martini glass, pfff vermouth once with the atomizer and voila - your martini. This is already very close to your suggestion of just drinking cold gin.

The famous Winston Churchill once said: ""The best Martini is a bottle of gin, that stood in the shadow of a bottle of vermouth.""

So there it is ;-)

There is no one perspective that is a definite answer to this question because there are many factors that must be taken into account.


How much alcohol is considered moderate?
What type of drink contains more calories and thus makes one gain weight more quickly?

How to drink moderately and how much alcohol in a drink is considered to be moderate?

Most people consider drinking by consuming a drink or two socially or in private. Drinking too much in some circumstances can lead to another alcohol poisoning.


  What is Moderate Alcohol Use?
  
  Guidelines for moderate drinking have been set by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization.
  
  
  The US guidelines suggest no more than 1 drink per day for women and no more than 2 drinks per day for men. A drink is defined as 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of spirits.
  The WHO guidelines suggest no more than 2 drinks per day, and no more than 5 drinking days per week. They recommend 2 non-drinking days. Of course, you can't stockpile your drinks, and have them all at the end of the week.
  
  
  A Standard Drink - The Definition of a Drink
  
  A standard drink is 14g of pure alcohol according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. The World Health Organization defines a drink as 10g of pure alcohol.
  
  Each milliliter of pure alcohol weighs 0.79 grams. Therefore, you can calculate the alcohol content of a drink with the following formula:
  
  
  1 can of beer (330 ml, 12 oz) at 5% (strength) x 0.79 (conversion factor) = 13 grams of alcohol
  1 glass of wine (140 ml, 5 oz) at 12% x 0.79 = 13.3 grams of alcohol
  1 shot of liquor (40 ml, 1.5 oz) at 40% x 0.79 = 12.6 grams of alcohol
  
  
  Note that a 750ml bottle of wine contains 5 drinks. Therefore 2 drinks a day is less than half a bottle of wine a day.
  
  
  
  Recommended Alcohol Guidelines - Moderate (Social) Drinking Plan


Now for the question of weight gain! Which drinks contain more calories and thus can make it more readily possible to get one fatter more quickly. The amount of carbohydrates must also be taken into account.


  Alcohol can either give you a beer belly or help you uncover your abs. After all, while one Archives of Internal Medicine study shows that people who put back one or two drinks a day are less likely to gain weight, research in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows that men consume an extra 433 calories on days they have just a couple of drinks.
  
  While lowered inhibitions and drink-fueled munchies have something to do with it, 61 percent of the caloric increase comes from the alcohol itself. So, if you're trying to lose weight while still enjoying the occasional drink, you'd better be wise about which drinks you choose. Here are the best and worst booze you can order.
  
  The Best Wine
  
  Red or white, you can expect to consume roughly 100 to 120 calories per glass. (That's assuming, however, that you're drinking a standardized 5-ounce glass. Research from Iowa State and Cornell shows that people tend to over-pour by 12 percent.)
  
  However, there are some considerations to make when picking grapes: White wine typically contains fewer carbohydrates than does red wine, which makes a small difference in terms of calories, says Caroline Cederquist, M.D., author of The MD Factor and creator of bistroMD. Meanwhile, red wine is richer in antioxidants, and a 2014 study in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, red wine's ellargic acids delay the growth of fat cells while slowing the development of new ones.
  
  Vermouth
  
  “A fortified wine with higher alcohol content and infused spices and herbs, vermouth is a calorie saver if you have it by itself—as it's commonly served in Europe,"" says Georgie Fear, R.D., author ofLean Habits for Lifelong Weight Loss. A 1.5-ounce serving contains a mere 64 calories, and typically contains about 15 to 18 percent alcohol, she says. Plus, research out of Budapest shows that it's jam-packed with polyphenol compounds, which may promote healthy weight loss.
  
  Still, remember that if you mix it into a Manhattan or martini, you're probably going to be consuming far more calories and sugar, Fear says.
  
  Straight Liquor
  
  When it comes to getting the most alcohol for the fewest calories, shots and straight booze on the rocks are the way to go. ""There isn't much of a difference between 80-proof hard liquors,"" Cederquist says. ""They all have around the same amount of calories and carbohydrates."" And as calories increase along with alcohol content, the difference isn't huge. For instance, a shot of 86-proof whiskey contains 105 calories and a shot of 80-proof vodka contains 97.
  
  However, you also need to keep in mind that the sweeter the liquor, the more calories it typically contains, she says. ""If you're looking for a lower calorie alternative, avoid the flavored vodkas and spiced rums and go for the original or 'plain' option offered,"" she says. ""If you are looking for a flavor boost, try low-calorie mixers like a flavored seltzer or fresh squeezed lemon or lime. This will provide the taste without the calories.""
  
  Light Beers
  
  With fewer calories and carbs, these are the best brewskis for weight loss, Cederquist says. Many light beers contain 90 to 100 calories per 12 ounces, while extra-light beers pack about 55 to 65.
  
  However, just don't use that as an excuse to have more beers than you typically would, or you'll undo all benefits. Hey, they generally pack less alcohol, right? Well, yeah, but they actually tend to have a higher percentage of their calories coming from alcohol compared to standard brews. Budweiser Select 55 for example derives 88.2 percent of its calories from alcohol, compared to Bud Light at 74.1 percent, and regular Budweiser at 66.9 percent calories, Fear says.
  
  The Worst
  
  Sugar-Packed Cocktails
  
  ""Margaritas and Long Island Iced Teas can set you back more calories than a large order of McDonald's French Fries,"" Fear says. Even worse, calories from sugar-laden drinks come as a sneak attack. When you drink a marg, your body is so overwhelmed with the alcohol content that your body doesn't properly metabolize the sugar. Instead, it stores the sweet stuff as fat.
  
  There is never a good excuse to drink these and other sugar-filled cocktails especially if you are trying to lose weight or not develop diabetes, she says. Now, if you've got a skilled mixologist behind your bar, you're probably calorically safe ordering a cocktail. After all, he'd never serve up one of these artless offenses.
  
  High-Alcohol Craft Beers
  
  ""The last five years have seen an explosion of craft breweries creating high-alcohol varieties, which pack more calories per bottle than you may realize,"" Fear says. Remember, more alcohol means more calories. Every gram of the good stuff contains seven calories.
  
  For instance, Flying Dog Horn Dog, which contains 10.2 percent alcohol by volume, also contains 314 calories per bottle, and Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA boasts 18 percent alcohol by volume, but also packs 450 calories into each bottle. That's a meal in a glass. Unfortunately, though, all that alcohol can wind up making you hungrier.
  
  The Best and Worst Booze to Drink if You Want to Lose Weight


If one deals with a gluten sensitivity, the only options is to avoid drinks with no gluten in them.


Wine is gluten free.
Sake is gluten free.
Distilled drinks are gluten free.
Most beers are not gluten free, however some are. This goes for some ciders as well.


This article explains it quite nicely: Gluten Free Beer, Alcohol and Wine

The end result is that all forms of drinking alcohol must be done in moderation. There is no one drink that is less hazardous to one’s health. Just keep it to one or two drinks a day.

If weight loss is on your mind, I would recommend a shot or two of straight (neat) liquor(s) or a light beer. Just because it is a light beer that should not be a license to drink as much as one wants, since moderation is always the key factor here.

Alcoholic drinks contain ethanol and methanol
Ethanol is the alcohol we want because it has the intoxicating effect we want without the detrimental effects of methanol that causes hangovers and blindness.
Cheaper drinks contain more bad and less good.
Particulates and dissolved solids also cause hangovers. 
So the more expensive and clearer the liquid the healthier it is. Providing the amount drunk is equivalent. Flushing with a pint or two of water before bed also mitigates the damage.
In conclusion vodka in the same alcohol concentration as the others would be the least harmful. Ie vodka watered down to the same percentage alcohol as the beer would do less harm.

  Khvanchkara is a high-end, naturally semi-sweet red wine made from the Alexandria &amp; Mudzhuretuli grape varieties cultivated in the Khvanchkara vineyards in Racha, Western Georgia. The wine has a strong, distinctive bouquet and a well-balanced tannin profile with flavors of raspberry. It has a dark ruby color. Khvanchkara wine is one of the most popular Georgian semi-sweet wines. It contains 10.5-12.0% alcohol, 3-5% sugar and has 5.0-7.0% titrated acidity. The wine has been made since 1907. It was awarded 2 gold and 4 silver medals at various international exhibitions.

7943,2,,2020-01-18T21:34:51.487,2,,"You CAN have a true absinthe that is well over 70 proof that has been properly steeped with herbs and then distilled. It is all about the distillation technique. If you use a double boil or oil bath method of distillation, you will get an extremely high proof blanched liquor. Other factors are the batch size, initial water content and type of still used. If you use a laboratory grade distillation set and work in 500-1000ml batches you can achieve a 180 proof Absinthe in the end result.

ALL distillate liquors are clear after distillation. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
Whiskey gets its brown color from the burnt wood on the inside of a whiskey barrel. Same with scotch, etc. Real distilled Absinthe is made green when green herbs containing chloryphyl are steeped in the clear liquor and then subsequently filtered out AFTER the distillation process is completed. 

You can tell if your absinthe is artificially colored by setting a small glass in the sun. If it has been colored by steeped herbs, it will turn brown as the sun's UV rays break down the chloryphyl. If however, it has been artificially colored, it will stay green. If it is sold in a clear bottle, it is most likely colored with artificial coloring, as tinted glass will block the UV and preserve the chloryphyl, whereas a clear glass container will not.

The BEST way to determine if your absinthe has been properly made with the right herbs and then distilled is to add cold water to the drink. If the absinthe goes milky, called opalescing, it has been made correctly with wormwood and distilled. If not, artificial coloring and flavorings, or a steep with herbs and simple filtration without distillation, has most likely been used to produce the end product.

That means it can improve blood flow - although the negatives far outweigh the positives and most people aren't required to take vasodilators and can be harmed by them. 

This is also where the old wives tale about drinking whiskey if you're cold comes from (think St Bernards). It can save your fingers from frost bite, but your body is actually restricting the blood flow for good reason - you may loose fingers but you have a better chance of survival - so it's better to only have that whiskey once you're back in the warmth. Drinking will relax the capillaries in your fingers and toes, allowing the warm blood from your centre-of-mass to flow. This actually means the overall temp of your body will cool down.

As to which kind is ""best"" it's simply the drink with the highest alcohol content.  Hence traditionally something such as Whiskey or Brandy. For added effect though, you could consider drinks with a high concentration of other naturally occurring vasodilators such as these (from first link):

Heady Topper helped really get the IPA scene roaring in NE, but wouldn't really fit a lot of people's expectations for a NE IPA now.  Nor would Lunch or Dinner, though all three are delicious.  They're just markedly different from, say, Congress Street from Trillium or Julius from Treehouse.

So, the real way to get into IPAs will be to look for local brewers who are making things and go try them.  There's a ton of variety within the style, so you'll just have to try things to find what you like.

The national brands can give you a sense of what to expect from the different variations, but that will just help you point in the right direction.

I don't know how widely distributed things in the midwest are, but Listerman's Brewering in Ohio makes some decent stuff, like Hank the Dumpster Kitty.  M-43 from Old Nation Brewing in Michigan is not too bad either.  I'm unfortunately not super familiar with that area though.

  Mushroom-Infused Beer Recipes
  
  Below you’ll find some basic beer recipes that incorporate mushrooms. Each recipe is sized to make 5 gallons of beer. However, given the broad range of ingredients available to homebrewers, you don’t have to limit yourself to the ingredients you see here. You can modify any existing recipe. Just be sure to formulate your beer to balance sweetness and bitterness. And consider making it a specialty regional beverage that incorporates local and organically grown ingredients. Have fun making your first mushroom beer, and “hopfully” many more!
  
  Turkey Tail Ale
  
  A golden pale ale with turkey tail (Trametes versicolor)
  
  
  6 pounds extra-light malted grain
   4 ounces fresh or 2 ounces dried turkey tail mushrooms
  1 ounce hops
  Ale yeast
  
  
  Iceman Amber
  
  An amber ale with birch polypore (Piptoporus betulinus) and amadou (Fomes fomentarius)
  
  
  6 pounds extra-light malted grain
  1 pound amber malt
   12 ounces carrot juice (preferably organic)
  4 ounces fresh or 2 ounces dried birch polypore mushrooms
  4 ounces fresh or 2 ounces dried amadou mushrooms
  1 ounce hops
  Ale yeast
  
  
  Reishi Red
  
  A natural red lager with reishi (Ganoderma spp.)
  
  
  6 pounds extra light malted grain
  1 pound amber malt
   12 ounces red beet juice (preferably organic)
   4 ounces fresh or 2 ounces dried reishi mushrooms
  1 ounce hops
  Ale yeast
  
  
  Agarikon Stout
  
  A dark, earthy brew with agarikon (Laricifomes officinalis, Fomitopsis officinalis)
  
  
  1 pound chocolate malted grain
  1 pound crystal malted grain
  5 pounds pale malted grain 
  2 ounces liquid agarikon mushroom extract (from colonized grain)
  1 ounce hops
  Trappist yeast
  
  
  Note: Agarikon is endangered and should not be harvested in the wild, but it is a powerful medicinal mushroom worthy of a stout beer. Since this mushroom cannot be cultivated in large quantities and the mycelium is slow to grow, the best option for this recipe is to allow myceliated cakes to supercolonize over the course of several months, until they are thick with biomass, and then prepare an extract from them. - Brew Outside the Box: Making Mushroom-Infused Beer


Technically speaking, working with mushrooms doesn’t pose any major technical hurdles during the brewing process, making it an easy ingredient to play around with, although approaches vary by brewery. Some infuse whole dried mushrooms into the wort (the water extracted during the mashing process), transforming the hot liquid into a sort of mushroom broth, which is then fermented and bottled. Others dry mushrooms and grind them into a powder, which is then made into a tea and added to the beer after fermentation is complete.

7971,2,,2020-02-14T23:42:24.140,5,,"Why do some people put olives in their beer?

Apart from the obvious reason, because they can, they seems to be couple of reasons for this.


Some individuals actually enjoy doing it.
Olives are paired quite nicely with some varieties of beer.
For some it is a sort of tradition: beertini.
It is part of barroom culture in the Midwest.



  Olives still have that much needed salty taste which keeps us thirsty and makes our beer that much more appreciated, and with so many varieties of olives available they make pairing with some great craft beers a perfect choice! And with olives being used in cocktails for decades why wouldn’t they work with beer? The key is finding the right match.
  
  Through some experimenting with various olives and types of beer, I came to one conclusion, and that was to not go any darker than an amber ale. Beers like stouts and deep IPA’s when tasted with olives felt a little bitter. The hops seemed to be competing with the olive and maybe the brine but anything lighter than an amber ale was really tasty!
  
  Here’s how some of my favorite Delallo olives ended up being a good pairing with five varieties of beer.
  
  Calamata Olives + Belgian Ale
  
  These are popular olives usually from Greece with a smooth skin and chewy bite to them. They’re definitely on the milder side for flavor and went really well alongside a light and crisp Belgian ale. Belgian beers are know to include spices in the fermentation process which also goes well with the olives.
  
  Piccante Green Pitted Olives + Hefeweizen
  
  Piccante means spicy and these Sevillano olives are combined with red pepper flakes. Although the olives aren’t too spicy I needed a beer that would tame the heat but still let the olive taste come through and Hefeweizen does that perfectly. The beer is crisp and should be served well chilled. This is the perfect snack pairing for a warm summers day!
  
  Castelvetrano Olives + Saison
  
  These Sicilian green olives are buttery and smooth with a soft bite and a mellow flavor. Pairing them with a light and fruity Saison made perfect sense. Saison’s are not that common amongst the rest of the belgian wheat beers but they have a distinctive crisp and fresh summery taste, making them a great pairing choice with the Castelvetrano’s.
  
  Olives Jubilee Mix + Red Amber Ale
  
  Because this mix consists of Kalamata, Picholine and green olives marinaded in savory spices, the choice for beer had to be a bold one but not as strong as a dark stout. Tasting these spiced olives with a red amber ale seemed to cut the happiness of the beer and elevate the spices in the olives. This pairing was probably the boldest of all of the combinations but still really tasty.
  
  Aglio Green Pitted Olives + Pilsner Lager
  
  Italian green olives with a texture much like the Castelvetrano’s but covered in chopped garlic pieces. The garlic isn’t overpowering and pairs well with a light Pilsner Lager. Some people might say this kind of beer isn’t very exciting. It’s really light but it lets the garlic shine through from the Aglio Olives. This is one for quick picnic on a hot summers day. Throw down a blanket and enjoy! - Olive and Beer Pairing Guide


Putting an olive in a glass of beer has become known as a beertini.


  At first glance, the “Beertini” is the ultimate dad joke—something that a sitcom father would facetiously claim as his favorite drink after overhearing someone order an Appletini. His flannel-shirt-wearing buddies would all chuckle and eye-roll as they clinked their mugs together, happy with their classic, no-fuss beer selection.
  
  In certain pockets of the Midwest, though, the combination of beer and olives known as the Beertini (also called the Minnesota, North Dakota or Wisconsin Martini, depending on where you’re located) is not only very real, but is deeply engrained in barroom culture.
  
  In its most elemental form, the Beertini is a drink and bar snack in one. The way a drinker preps his or her Beertini relies both on what’s available and on individual taste: a canned beer or a draft beer can be used, as can a stein or a lager glass, and the olive count can range from just a few to a whole bowl if the spirit moves you. Beertini-crafting is a trial and error process.
  
  What the drink lacks in a colorful origin story (no one quite knows—or, frankly, cares—where the first Beertini came to be), it makes up for in simple best practices. Craft beer varieties need not apply and the olives can only be green, the kind most often found swimming in their own juices on dusty bar tops. Want to get wild and use a pimento or blue cheese-stuffed green olive? Not a problem. Try to drop a black olive in your beer, though, and watch the room raise a collective eyebrow.
  
  The olives—and, often, a splash of olive juice—brighten up the beer, spotlighting how the humblest of ingredients can become the perfect odd couple. They also offer a charming lesson in barroom chemistry. When plunked into a glass of beer, the olives neither settle at the bottom nor lollygag around at the top of the glass. Instead, they bob up and down, sinking and rising like tiny, edible submarines. It’s downright hypnotic.
  
  Travel a little further down into South Dakota, and you’ll encounter a variation unceremoniously dubbed “Red Beer” (sometimes known unappetizingly as a “Bloody Beer”), which calls on both olives and tomato juice to brighten up a standard lager. The addition of tomato juice draws parallels to the Michelada—minus some of the spice, of course. But no one is quite sure if the two share a common ancestor, or if it is, perhaps, a case of multiple independent discoveries in the same vein as calculus or the theory of natural selection.
  
  There also seem to be an almost infinite number of permutations and combinations for the way Red Beer can be crafted. Several people suggest swapping out the tomato for orange juice if it’s before noon to create a “poor man’s Mimosa,” while others claim the more olives you can plop into the glass, the better. A few even prefer the additional crunch of a pickle.
  
  Weber estimates you can find Red Beer (or a Beertini) in just about every single neighborhood bar across South Dakota, but seems less optimistic about the drink’s ultimate future. Craft breweries have been frothing up all over the Midwest for years now, supported largely by a boom of millennial enthusiasts, while Beertinis and Red Beer are the barroom hacks of a former generation.
  
  But it’s hard to imagine olive-speckled beer steins disappearing anytime soon. The practice is, after all, a true testament to the creativity of Midwestern drinkers and their spirit of brassy, briny industriousness. - How the Beertini Became a Midwestern Staple


Some bars in Spain serve olives as a bar snack, so it seems beer and olives are a little more commonplace than simply just the Midwest!

7972,2,,2020-02-15T01:11:46.873,1,,"Can all sugars be used for brewing?

I would venture to say yes for the most part. That is all sugars expect maltodextrin and lactose.


  What is Sugar?
  
  But before I can answer the questions above, I do need to lay some groundwork and describe the different building blocks. It won’t take long and once you understand what everything is made of, it becomes a lot easier to understand the answers. All sugars are carbohydrates, molecules that contain both carbon (carbo-) and hydrogen (-hydrate) atoms. Carbohydrates have the general formula of CnH2nOn, meaning they have one carbon (C) and one oxygen (O) to every two hydrogens (H2). In sugars, the “n” usually equals 5 or 6. For example, glucose has the formula C6H12O6, meaning it is constructed of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms. Incidentally, fructose also has the formula C6H12O6, but the atoms are arranged differently in the molecule.
  
  The most common type of sugar is called glucose (aka. dextrose, blood sugar, corn sugar). Glucose is a monosaccharide, hexose-type sugar, meaning that it is a single molecule consisting of six carbon atoms. Other hexoses relevant to brewing are fructose and galactose. Elementally, these monosaccharides are all the same, but they are isomers of each other i.e., their chemical structure and arrangement gives them different properties. For instance, an isomer of glucose called fructose (also known as fruit sugar), tastes sweeter than glucose.
  
  Let’s examine the sugars found in a typical beer wort made from 2-row barley base malt. The main constituent of wort is maltose, which typically comprises around 50% of the total carbohydrates in wort. This is followed by maltotriose, which comprises around 18% of the total carbohydrates. The remainder of the wort is made up of glucose (10%), sucrose (8%), fructose (2%) and finally assorted dextrins, which together account for 12% of the wort carbohydrates.
  
  Maltose is a glucose disaccharide, which means that it is made up of two glucose molecules. Sucrose is another disaccharide and consists of one glucose and one fructose. Sucrose is a naturally occurring plant sugar, and is used as table sugar worldwide. Sources include sugar cane, beets, maple sap and nectar. Maltotriose is a trisaccharide consisting of three glucose molecules. Dextrins (aka. oligosaccharides) are larger carbohydrates consisting of more than three monosaccharide groups. Monosaccharides are sweeter tasting than polysaccharides. In descending order of sweetness: fructose is sweeter than sucrose, which is sweeter than glucose, which is sweeter than maltose, which is sweeter than maltotriose.
  
  Fermentation
  
  Yeast are apparently very methodical little organisms. Even though sucrose usually comprises only a small percentage of the wort, studies have shown that most brewers yeast strains seem to work on it first — breaking it down into its glucose and fructose components. Once the sucrose has been broken down, the yeast cells consume the glucose first, followed by fructose, maltose and finally maltotriose. Some yeast strains behave differently; consuming maltose at the same time as the monosaccharides, but this seems to be the exception.
  
  Most yeast strains are glucophilic, utilizing most of the glucose in the wort before consuming the other monosaccharides. They also ferment most of the monosaccharides before fermenting maltose and subsequently maltotriose. In fact, it is known that high levels of glucose and fructose in a wort (e.g. >15–20%) will inhibit the fermentation of maltose. This repressive behavior is probably a common cause of stuck fermentations in worts containing a lot of refined sugars — the yeast have fermented the monosaccharides and then quit, leaving more than half of the total sugars unfermented.
  
  Yeast metabolize the different wort sugars in different ways. To consume the disaccharide sucrose, the yeast utilizes an enzyme called invertase, which works outside the cell to hydrolyze the molecule into its components — glucose and fructose. The glucose and fructose molecules are then transported through the cell wall and metabolized inside the cell. Conversely, maltose and maltotriose are transported into the cell first, and then are broken down into glucoses by the enzyme maltase. Even though the enzyme for both sugars is the same, maltose is typically consumed first, indicating that the cell wall transport mechanism for the two sugars is different. Maybe maltotriose is too big to get through the maltose door!
  
  The take-home message is that all fermentable sugars are broken down into monosaccharides like glucose before being utilized by the yeast, and that yeast evidently prefer to eat their sugars one course at a time. This has big implications for wort formulation in our pursuit of new recipes and unique styles.
  
  
  
  Lots of different sugars can be used in brewing, and now that we know what the yeast want to eat and when, we can make better choices for their use. Which brings us to a good starting point — why would we want to use anything other than the sugars that come naturally form the barley?

Beer is kind of self limiting because it fills you up and limits how much you can drink. Avoid things like red wine, whisky and mixed drinks with a lot of sugar. They will make you the sickest.

  Beer Drunk
  
  Freshman 15, comes from no other then beer. People end up drinking more beer because it isn't as strong as other alcohol but it can get you really [messed] up if you drink an excessive amount. There are many activities that make drinking beer so much fun and encourage drinking. Beer pong, flip cup, slap cup, keg stands etc...

  Yes, you can taste the difference between good and cheap vodka. The [crummy] type of vodka burns your throat like rubbing alcohol, especially when you're taking shots. Expect a loud and fun person that is down to do anything if they're vodka drunk. And please, keep your vodka in the freezer (it tastes so much better.)
  
  Wine Drunk
  
  One of the reasons people love drinking wine, is because they think they look classy drinking it. Wine is safe and reliable but the spins can hit you out of no where. It has the ability to cheer you up when you are down but it can also drown you in tears. Best part of it all - no one will judge you for having a glass of wine mid day (perhaps a bottle over lunch)
  
  Whiskey Drunk
  
  Whiskey is a popular choice for dark liquor and sometimes things can get out of hand. People tend to be aggressive and turn into a completely different persona when they consume an excessive amount of whiskey. They'll most likely get into a physical fight or verbally insult the easiest target. There's a serious love-hate relationship between whiskey and people.
  
  Tequila Drunk

Such microemulsions occur with only minimal mixing and are highly stable. 


Do not forget that drinking water can lesson the effects of a hangover.


  While food and water may ease some of the symptoms, they won’t cure a hangover. The best way to avoid one is to moderate your drinking and have water between alcoholic drinks. Remember that water won’t make you any less drunk or protect your liver. - Alcohol myth buster

To answer the clarification in the comments:

Often wine is blended to bring in the best parts of different grapes:


  The goal in blending is to bring together wines that don’t stand alone to make a wine that is superior to its parts. There is a big difference between blending, which is meant to improve your wine, and mixing, which is intended to make something — like an off-flavor —go away. Source: WineMaker


Personally - being brought up to appreciate good wines - the idea of mixing red and white is blasphemy. They are just too different and therefore do not follow the ""rules"" laid out in the link above. 

However, I did find evidence that it has been considered - I imagine you could end up with a wine very similar to a Rose if you got the balance right. I'm not sure I can really credit that with being a ""source"" though.

This answer has been asked elsewhere though and, although I don't often like to just copy and paste an answer from elsewhere but the last paragraph seemed exactly what you are looking for:


  Rosé is popular nowadays and some producers do mix red and white wine grapes in order to satisfy demand, it's all about business, after all, however, such wines tend to be made of not very high quality grapes because there is no point in mixing the grapes or wines of premium quality together since they will cancel out their flavours anyway. Sometimes, producers will add some extra sugar to the mix in order to balance out or mask the shortcomings of taste that appeared due to mixing the products that are not supposed to be mixed.

  The word whisky (or whiskey) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce (or uisge) meaning ""water"" (now written as uisce in Modern Irish, and uisge in Scottish Gaelic). Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae (""water of life""). This was translated into Old Irish as uisce beatha (""water of life""), which became uisce beatha in Irish and uisge beatha [ˈɯʃkʲə ˈbɛhə] in Scottish Gaelic. Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe (1581), usquebaugh (1610), usquebath (1621), and usquebae (1715).

The technical term for smell is odour.

An odor (American English) or odour (British English; see spelling differences) is caused by one or more volatilized chemical compounds that are generally found in low concentrations that humans and animals can perceive by their sense of smell. An odor is also called a ""smell"" or a ""scent"", which can refer to either a pleasant or an unpleasant odor.


  While ""scent"" can refer to pleasant and unpleasant odors, the terms ""scent"", ""aroma"", and ""fragrance"" are usually reserved for pleasant-smelling odors and are frequently used in the food and cosmetic industry to describe floral scents or to refer to perfumes.
  
  In the United Kingdom and other Commonweath, English-speaking nations, ""odour"" refers to scents in general – without positive or negative connotations; but in the United States, and for many non-native English speakers around the world, ""odor"" generally has a negative connotation as a synonym for ""stink"".1 An unpleasant odor can also be described as ""reeking"" or called a ""malodor"", ""stench"", ""pong"", or ""stink"".


Taste is simply the gustatory perception of flavours while eating or drinking foods. 


  Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses which belongs to the gustatory system.
  
  Taste in the gustatory system allows humans to distinguish between safe and harmful food, and to gauge foods’ nutritional value. Digestive enzymes in saliva begin to dissolve food into base chemicals that are washed over the papillae and detected as tastes by the taste buds. The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds.3 The exception to this are the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 50004 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.
  
  Bitter foods are generally found unpleasant, while sour, salty, sweet, and umami tasting foods generally provide a pleasurable sensation. The five specific tastes received by taste receptors are saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and savoriness, often known by its Japanese term ""umami"" which translates to ‘deliciousness’. As of the early twentieth century, Western physiologists and psychologists believed there were four basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, and bitterness. At that time, savoriness was not identified, but now a large number of authorities recognize it as the fifth taste.

Safe for the stomach rate of alcohol
Any alcohol above 40% of course damages the mucous membranes (chemical burn) [...] Strong alcohol provokes esophagitis, gastritis, gastro-duodenitis.in constant use are formed of chronic inflammatory diseases and are prerequisites for cancer of the esophagus and stomach.

The above statements can be somewhat corroborated, through more reputable sources. The Oklahoma State Government has patrol officer training material that describes how alcohol passes through the body and it's effect. The training is relatively easy to follow and in my opinion, interesting. The takeaway here is that alcohol is not digested. It is absorbed mostly by membranes in the esophagus, the stomach, and the small intestine. The rate of absorption is in part determined by an equilibrium with alcohol and water on either side of the membrane. This means that the higher concentration of alcohol, the faster it's absorbed into your body. This article published in Clinics in Liver Disease, an Elsevier journal, goes over some of the fancy chemistry and largely goes over my head. However it has this to say...

Alcohol has irritant properties and high concentrations can cause superficial erosions, hemorrhages and paralysis of the stomach smooth muscle.

It also says

Peak blood alcohol levels are higher if ethanol is ingested as a single dose rather than several smaller doses, probably because alcohol concentration gradient will be higher in the former case.

So even after drinking the same amount of alcohol you may have a higher BAC, and your body processes higher concentrations of alcohol differently than lower concentrations. It can be rough on your stomach. That said, having a meal before you drink does a lot to slow the rate of absorption.
I believe that most of the concern people have about high ABV drinks, at least in the United States, stems from rumors about moonshine. Moonshine is one of the most widely known high-alcohol spirits. If improperly made it can blind or kill you. Many people don't understand what causes these effects and associate it with the high-alcohol content. However these side effects are usually caused by wood-alcohol, a byproduct of poor distilling technique. They can also be caused by lead-poisoning, which can happen if you make booze in lead pipes. &quot;Moonshine&quot; that you see in the store is regulated and safe.

The short answer is no.

The most highly rated of its wines are the frizzante (slightly sparkling) red wines, designed to be drunk young. Aged wines are generally not an issue here and generally speaking are on the more inexpensive price range. But this is not absolute. It does have some historical value to its name also.


  Lambrusco is the name of both an Italian red wine grape and a wine made principally from said grape. The grapes and the wine originate from four zones in Emilia-Romagna and one in Lombardy―principally around the central provinces of Modena, Parma, Reggio-Emilia, and Mantua. The grape has a long winemaking history, with archaeological evidence indicating that the Etruscans cultivated the vine. In Roman times Lambrusco was highly valued for its productivity and high yields, with Cato the Elder stating that produce of two thirds of an acre could make enough wine to fill 300 amphoras.
  
  The most highly rated of its wines are the frizzante (slightly sparkling) red wines, designed to be drunk young, from one of the eight Lambrusco denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regions: Colli di Parma Lambrusco, Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro, Lambrusco di Sorbara, Lambrusco Salamino di Santa Croce, Reggiano Lambrusco, Colli di Scandiano e Canossa Lambrusco, Modena Lambrusco, and Lambrusco Mantovano. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s sweet Lambrusco was the biggest selling import wine in the United States. During that time the wine was also produced in a white and rosé style made by limiting the skin contact with the must.


Today, there are various levels of dryness / sweetness, including secco (bone dry / dry), amabile (off-dry / sweet) and dolce (very sweet). Sweet Lambrusco became hugely popular in the United States in the late 1970s-1980s, reaching a high of over 13 million cases exported to the country in 1985. The wine is noted for high acidity and berry flavors. Many of the wines now exported to the United States include a blend of Lambruscos from the different DOCs and are sold under the Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) designation Emilia.


  The wine is rarely made in a ""champagne"" (metodo classico) style; instead, it is typically made using the Charmat process where a second fermentation is conducted in a pressurized tank.
  
  In Australia a number of cheaper bottled and box wines are produced by Australian vineyards and sold as ""Lambrusco"". They are typically medium-sweet, around 10% ABV and styled as an ""easy drinking"" product.


Some Lambrusco wine  will taste cheap, but I imagine not all.


  Lambrusco Wines Worth Drinking
  
  Upon the boisterous expression of the beauty of Lambrusco, you may be remonstrated with something like,
  
  “You mean that cheap, sweet red wine that tastes like soda?”
  
  Well not exactly, but yes, that one. Apparently, Lambrusco still has a long way to go since it tarnished its reputation nearly 40 years ago (blame the wine boom of the 1970s). Fortunately, this means you can find great wines for obscenely good prices. Lambrusco is awesome and its story is more fascinating than probably imagined.
  
  Lambrusco Wines Worth Drinking
  
  Lambrusco is actually a family of very old grape varieties native to Italy. Most wines are a blend of several distinct varieties, each with a unique taste profile. It is unclear exactly when these varieties manifested, but Cato may have mentioned them in De Agri Cultura in 160 BC – humanity’s oldest printed farming manual. So when you drink Lambrusco, you are drinking some O.G. juice (several millennia older than Cabernet).
  
  Today, the best Lambruscos are dry (secco) and barely sweet (semisecco) and are almost always made in a semi-sparkling, frizzante, style. There are about 10 different varieties (8 closely related varieties, to be exact). That said, there are the 4 high quality varieties you should know: Lambrusco di Sorbara, Lambrusco Maestri, Lambrusco Grasparossa, and Lambrusco Salamino. These four offer the complete range of styles and they’ll match with an incredible array of foods from Korean barbecue to Argentinian empanadas.
  
  Classy Lambrusco Wines to Try
  
  Lambrusco di Sorbara
  
  This grape produces the lightest and most delicate and floral of the Lambrusco wines, often in a light, pink-rose hue. The best versions are in a dry and refreshing style but have delightfully sweet aromas of orange blossom, mandarin orange, cherries, violets, and watermelon. You’ll find these wines labeled primarily as Lambrusco di Sorbara and they pair extremely well with spicy Thai and Indian cuisine.
  
  Lambrusco Grasparossa
  
  This is the grape that makes the boldest Lambrusco wines with flavors of black currant and blueberries, supported by moderately high, mouth-drying tannin and a balancing creaminess from the Charmat sparkling production process. You’ll find this wine labeled as Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro (which includes 85% of this grape) and is great to pair with fennel-infused sausages, lasagna, or even barbecue ribs.
  
  Lambrusco Maestri
  
  Wines of Lambrusco Maestri are more grapey with soft and creamy bubbles and subtle notes of milk chocolate. L. Maestri is actually the most well-travelled of all the Lambrusco varieties and there are some excellent examples coming out of Australia (Adelaide Hills) and Argentina (Mendoza). It’s a little harder to find a single-varietal Lambrusco Maestri in Italy, although to quote Italian wine expert, Ian d’Agata,
  
  
    “Try: Cantine Ceci, Nero di Lambrusco Otello, guaranteed to change your mind about Lambrusco forever and turn you into a believer.” Ian d’Agata, Native Wine Grapes of Italy
  
  
  Lambrusco Salamino
  
  This Lambrusco has cylindrical salami-shaped bunches (which is what the grape is named after). These wines have the delightful aromatic qualities of Lambrusco di Sorbara (imagine cherries and violets) with the structure (tannin), creaminess, and deep color of Lambrusco Grasparossa. Expect Lambrusco Salamino to be made in sweetest styles, including semisecco and and dolce to counterbalance its tannin – oddly enough, the sweetness makes it a great match for burgers. This variety can be found labeled as Reggiano Lambrusco Salamino and Lambrusco Salamino di Santa Croce.

And this successfully means I have had 1 hangover in 40 years of drinking.

And while some subscribe to the idea that certain types of alcohol make you drunk differently to others, I have to say that doesn't match my experience. Cheap spirits can feel nasty, but any good drink can be drunk in moderation or excess and get you to the level of drunk you require.

Tequila, for example - teenagers may try cheap tequila or chartreuse shots, not good taste, but they do get you drunk quickly and cheaply. A good quality tequila or reposado, however, can be enjoyed as a sipping drink, like a good whisky or absinthe. Much more enjoyable at my age.

  A mushroom, or toadstool, is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source.
  
  The standard for the name ""mushroom"" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence the word ""mushroom"" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. ""Mushroom"" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.
  
  Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as ""bolete"", ""puffball"", ""stinkhorn"", and ""morel"", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called ""agarics"" in reference to their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term ""mushroom"" can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the thallus (called a mycelium) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms, or the species itself.

  A price is the quantity of payment or compensation given by one party to another in return for one unit of goods or services.1 A price is influenced by both production costs and demand for the product. A price may be determined by a monopolist or may be imposed on the firm by market conditions.
  
  In modern economies, prices are generally expressed in units of some form of currency. (For commodities, they are expressed as currency per unit weight of the commodity, e.g. euros per kilogram or Rands per KG.) Although prices could be quoted as quantities of other goods or services, this sort of barter exchange is rarely seen. Prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps and air miles. In some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as currency, for example in prisons, in times of hyperinflation, and in some places during World War II. In a black market economy, barter is also relatively common.
  
  In many financial transactions, it is customary to quote prices in other ways. The most obvious example is in pricing a loan, when the cost will be expressed as the percentage rate of interest. The total amount of interest payable depends upon credit risk, the loan amount and the period of the loan. Other examples can be found in pricing financial derivatives and other financial assets. For instance the price of inflation-linked government securities in several countries is quoted as the actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since the security was issued.
  
  ""Price"" sometimes refers to the quantity of payment requested by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount. This requested amount is often called the asking price or selling price, while the actual payment may be called the transaction price or traded price. Likewise, the bid price or buying price is the quantity of payment offered by a buyer of goods or services, although this meaning is more common in asset or financial markets than in consumer markets.
  
  Economic price theory asserts that in a free market economy the market price reflects interaction between supply and demand: the price is set so as to equate the quantity being supplied and that being demanded. In turn these quantities are determined by the marginal utility of the asset to different buyers and to different sellers. Supply and demand, and hence price, may be influenced by other factors, such as government subsidy or manipulation through industry collusion.
  
  When a commodity is for sale at multiple locations, the law of one price is generally believed to hold. This essentially states that the cost difference between the locations cannot be greater than that representing shipping, taxes, other distribution costs and more.

8015,2,,2020-03-19T22:54:54.160,-1,,"One can make outstanding rosé by mixing red and white grapes, but that is not the same thing as mixing red and white wine.  Based on process, rosé is made (with an exception to be described below) just as a white wine:  fermenting only the juice of a grape, not the skins.  Fermentation in this instance is what happens when yeast consumes the sugars in the must (defined as the juice or juice/skins - possibly stems, too, whatever is being fermented)).   Red wines are made by fermenting juice and skin of grapes.  A wine's color primarily comes from the skins.  Most 'red' or 'black' grapes used for wine have dark skins, but clear flesh.  If you press them quickly and remove the skins, you'll have white juice (blanc de noirs, in French wine terms).  To make a rosé, vintners typically take red grapes, press them gently, and let the juice and skins macerate together for a short time in order for some of the pigments from skin tint the still unfermented juice.  When the winemaker decides there is enough color, he/she/they removes the skins and then ferments the now pink juice.  Just like white wines, there is no fermentation on the skins.  It should be added that many white wines are made with some amount of pre-fermentation skin contact, too, since the winemaker might want to extract some aromatic or structural elements from the skins. Since 'white' grapes don't have dark color, this extraction does not significantly change the color of the unfermented juice or must.  A winemaker might decided that the rosé might be improved by blending some unfermented juice from white grapes to the must, or, perhaps, blend the fermented pink juice (now wine), with other fermented white juice, again, wine.  Understand, the pink wine (rosé) is not red wine.  It is made just like white wine - especially those white wines made by some pre-fermentation skin contact as described above.    This blending is not at all a cheat. Some of the finest rosé wines are made that way, including the most expensive still rosé on the market, Gérard Bertrand's Clos du Temple, made from Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah, Mourvèdre, and Viognier, the  latter being a white grape, retails for $190/bottle. A great number of far less expensive rosés are made similarly.   

So, about the exception: sparkling rosé wine can be made by blending a little red wine into white. The reason for this might be chalked up to historical precedence as well problems getting red grapes properly ripe in the Champagne region of northern France, but also since most quality sparkling wine is made by a process of double fermentation.  That is, a base, still wine is made that is then put into bottles with a little yeast and a little sugar, then sealed by using a crown cap (a soda bottle cap).

  One can make outstanding rosé by mixing red and white grapes, but that is not the same thing as mixing red and white wine.  Based on process, rosé is made (with an exception to be described below) just as a white wine:  fermenting only the juice of a grape, not the skins.  Fermentation in this instance is what happens when yeast consumes the sugars in the must (defined as the juice or juice/skins - possibly stems, too, whatever is being fermented)).   Red wines are made by fermenting juice and skin of grapes.  A wine's color primarily comes from the skins.  Most 'red' or 'black' grapes used for wine have dark skins, but clear flesh.  If you press them quickly and remove the skins, you'll have white juice (blanc de noirs, in French wine terms).  To make a rosé, vintners typically take red grapes, press them gently, and let the juice and skins macerate together for a short time in order for some of the pigments from skin tint the still unfermented juice.  When the winemaker decides there is enough color, he/she/they removes the skins and then ferments the now pink juice.  Just like white wines, there is no fermentation on the skins.  It should be added that many white wines are made with some amount of pre-fermentation skin contact, too, since the winemaker might want to extract some aromatic or structural elements from the skins. Since 'white' grapes don't have dark color, this extraction does not significantly change the color of the unfermented juice or must.  A winemaker might decided that the rosé might be improved by blending some unfermented juice from white grapes to the must, or, perhaps, blend the fermented pink juice (now wine), with other fermented white juice, again, wine.  Understand, the pink wine (rosé) is not red wine.  It is made just like white wine - especially those white wines made by some pre-fermentation skin contact as described above.    This blending is not at all a cheat. Some of the finest rosé wines are made that way, including the most expensive still rosé on the market, Gérard Bertrand's Clos du Temple, made from Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah, Mourvèdre, and Viognier, the  latter being a white grape, retails for $190/bottle. A great number of far less expensive rosés are made similarly.   


So, about the exception: sparkling rosé wine can be made by blending a little red wine into white. The reason for this might be chalked up to historical precedence as well problems getting red grapes properly ripe in the Champagne region of northern France, but also since most quality sparkling wine is made by a process of double fermentation.  That is, a base, still wine is made that is then put into bottles with a little yeast and a little sugar, then sealed by using a crown cap (a soda bottle cap). The yeast consumes the sugar, creating the by-products of alcohol (not much, since there isn't much sugar) and carbon dioxide, which creates the bubbles. A good deal of this base wine is in fact made from red grapes like Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, which are pressed quickly with skins immediately removed, often blended with Chardonnay, in order to make white sparkling wine.

Are there any other know sales of some wine, beer or other alcoholic drinks that have plummeted due to such naming similarities  in the present pandemic or some other historically known pandemic, even at a local level?


  As of February 2020, after the COVID-19 coronavirus spread throughout China, Corona suffered a $170 million loss in earnings in the country. The company attributed the sales drop to fewer people going out in public, with many bars and restaurants being forced to close down. Multiple brands of beer experienced relative sales slumps in the country, as the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus had generally dampened public activities. Sales were typically high over the period, due to Chinese New Year celebrations. - Corona (beer)

Mexican beer rebrands as Ebola to avoid association with coronavirus


  Mexico City (dpo) - The dangerous coronavirus is spreading quickly and is a source of fear for many. In order to avoid associations with the negative headlines, Mexican commercial brewery Grupo Modelo has announced that its most popular beer, Corona Extra, is to be rebranded as Ebola Extra. “We don’t want our customers to feel like they are drinking an infectious disease,” explained a spokesperson for Grupo Modelo, hence the decision to go for a worldwide rebrand.
  
  The new name, Ebola, is a neologism with a lovely ring to it according to the brewery. It stands for Extremo abocado liquido con ácido ascórbico or “very quaffable liquid containing ascorbic acid.” Ascorbic acid is an ingredient of Corona (now Ebola) along with water, hops, yeast, barley malt, maize, rice and papain.
  
  The rebrand will be part of a multimedia ad campaign featuring the catchy slogan, “I’m doing great. I’ve got Ebola.

Black Plague craft beer might fit the bill also.



Baphomet - Graphic Stein

If you can not find a ”quarantine beer” in your neighbourhood or home, perhaps to can just go ahead and drink your favourite beer in a beer stein. After all they came out with lids during the bubonic plague as a means to reduce infections from insects.


  Some 500 years ago Europe was inundated with swarms of flies during the summer months. This combined with memories of the plague called for some sort of action by citizens.
  
  By the 1500s folks in Germany had figured out that the plague had taken fewer victims in areas that adhered to certain hygienic standards. Cleanliness made a difference in who lived and who died so laws were passed to encourage citizens to leave their filthy ways to the past. One of those laws was that all food and beverage containers had to have lids to protect people from dirty insects.
  
  Covered containers were just a small part of the movement to clean up the community. Another law required that beer could only be made from hops, cereals, yeast and water. This allowed for a better quality beer and did away with the recipes that made beer from rotten bread and such.
  
  Long story short is that the beer industry took off in Germany and has never looked back. The covered beer stein was one innovation that took the fancy of the population long after the threat of disease had passed. The upper class would have had their beer steins made from pewter but the commoner would have embraced those made of pottery. Other mediums used would have included ivory, porcelain, wood, silver and more. Everyone would have had their own individual stein and some of them could be right fancy. All sorts of designs from coats of arms to biblical scenes have turned up on the outside of these steins.
  
  When the industrial age hit beer steins became less expensive to make. Instead of individually molding pottery into a mug they could now be mass produced with each design having a sharpness once associated with the hand made. Strong pottery seemed to be the chosen medium for most steins however glass and pewter did enter the market in a big way.
  
  Finding one of these beauties would be a treat for the collector. Over a 500 year period there would have been lots of steins made in Germany for the discerning collector to find. For the collector of the original steins they can expect to pay hundreds of dollars. Those who collect steins issued by American breweries will pay considerably less. - Beer stein an invention caused by the bubonic plague

They use salt when downing chile peppers, for example. By the same token, citrus juices of various kinds have long been used to kill the aftertaste of the more potent forms of alcohol [...] Anyway, when tequila came to the U.S., the salt and lime (or lemon) bit came with it.


Further, Stanford University Press Blog states that salt and lime were used to mask bad tequila:


  Legend holds that the origin of serving salt and lime with tequila evolved as a response to an early tequila “boom” in the late 19th-century. The unpredicted spike in popularity led to a proliferation of poor quality tequila brands; salt and lemon were used to mask the taste of crudely-made tequila.

  Ingredients
  
  2 1/2 cups Diet Coke™
  
  1/3 cup Captain Morgan™ original spiced rum
  
  1/3/cup Kahlúa™


My friend told me that using Diet Coke worked better than the regular coke.

Wanting to make some for a nice form of distraction, I wanted to find out if a particular shape of popsicle would stay harder longer. Here is what I found out. 


  Slightly flat Coke will produce a popsicle that stays frozen longer. To quickly and manually flatten out the carbonation, empty out enough Coke from a 2-liter bottle to leave a 3-inch space from top of bottle to top of coke. Place cap back on and shake vigorously for 10 seconds. Set aside to leave bubbles to subside. - Dirty Pirate Popsicle


The following is taken from Quora:


  Do Ice shapes matter? If so, which shape of Ice keeps my drink colder the longest?
  
  The larger the surface area, the faster the ice will melt. A cube of ice will last longer than a flat slab of ice of the same mass. The shape with the smallest surface area per volume is a sphere.
  
  A spherical piece of ice would melt slower than any other shape. There are moulds available to make spherical ice cubes, and they are favoured by some people who use them in alcoholic drinks because they take longer to water down the beverage.


That is right round popsicle moulds work best for any alcoholic popsicles!

  it’s brewed in enormous quantities


If you look at the aggregate cost, it is indeed almost certainly the most expensive beer in the world to brew and age, because they make so much of it. The total cost for brewing Budweiser probably far exceeds the cost of brewing any other single recipe, year over year. 

Per bottle, however is a different story.  Budweiser isn't particularly cheap, from a bill of materials perspective, but it isn't exceptionally expensive either.  However when it was introduced, it was extremely expensive.  At retail it cost the equivalent of $17 a bottle today. The cost savings today are largely due to efficiencies in integration, scale, and processes.  

So is it still true that it's the most expensive beer to produce today?  On a per bottle basis, certainly not.  That doesn't mean, however, that they're cutting corners on production, but as the comments noted, simply taking whatever legal liberties are available to them when making that claim.

The way the bottles are stored may become a factor if you are going to store them for longer periods of time. The way the bottles were stored might affect their value if you were to sell them later on.

Usually beers intended for long storage would have cork and muselet, rather than a metallic cap. You can mitigate the effects of the metallic caps by storing the bottles in an upright position so the beer makes as little contact with the cap as possible. High quality beers would typically be in dark bottles to protect them from light. Storing the bottles in pitch black would probably be a good idea if you wanted them to last for that long.

  Aging beer allows time for flavors not immediately present to develop

  Rule #3, Darker malts create sherry and port flavors with age.
  
  Beers should be cellared bellow their fermentation temperature.

There are many styles and types of whisky, or whiskey with an 'e', and it's made all around the world. There are distinct and famous styles from Ireland, Japan, and the United States. Sullivan's Cove from Australia, Mackmyra from Sweden, and Kavalan from Taiwan have all made award winning whiskys. There are at least 4 whisky distilleries in Toronto, Canada alone.
Not every whisky made in Scotland can even technically be called a Scotch, there are regulations that Scotch follows and some distillers will step outside of those bounds for creative reasons. Scotch regions are also individually recognized for their unique styles.
Often in areas where there is no strong history of whisky, each distillery will kind of do their own thing because the drinkers of the region don't have strong expectations of what the whiskey should be. This is especially true in today's global economy, consumers have tasted bottles from all over the world so there is no accepted standard in new markets. The distillers will borrow ideas from regions that do have a strong tradition, mostly they just try to make something that tastes good. So even though Japanese whisky, for example, was borne essentially directly from Scotch in the 60's, there are strong differences between them. Some of this is because whisky highballs are super popular in Japan, and whiskys will be blended with this in mind. Some of this is for technical reasons, different altitudes make for different distillation temperatures.
In conclusion, they different... probably.

Just as gluten intolerance will vary with individuals, so will recommendations for gluten-free beer recommendations vary as being preferred by individuals, at any given time.
As for myself, I too am gluten-intolerant (celiac), but taste is a whole different ballgame. I started out by going to the government liquor stores to ask about the best beers for celiac suffers.
Naturally they were non-committal in their recommendations, but one in fact said to avoid any buckwheat brewed beer as the taste (flavour) was quite  strong and many seemed to not truly enjoy the taste. But then, taste is a personal preference. Just as buckwheat honey goes, I prefer an other type of honey. Buckwheat has a strong flavour to say the least.
Other than recommending that you ask your local liquor stores what they recommend, I will simply recommend these as coming from the net,  the  10 Best Gluten-Free Beers:

GREEN’S AMBER ALE
IPSWICH ALE BREWERY, CELIA SAISON
TWO BROTHERS PRAIRIE PATH GOLDEN ALE
STONE DELICIOUS IPA
BRUNEHAUT BELGIAN TRIPEL
OMISSION LAGER
GLUTENBERG IPA
MIKKELLER PETER PALE AND MARY
NEUMARKTER LAMMSBRÄU PURE LAGER

As I said before taste is a personal choice, but I do not personally prefer buckwheat beer, as it is a strong flavoured tasting beer. Once again tasre is a personal matter.
Ultimately, I recommend you talk to your local outlets and find out what is popular on the local market.
Personally I prefer a natural hop flavoured beer. Do not know why but it tastes good to me.
As far as I am concerned I have turned over to gluten-free ciders as my personal go to choice.

8091,2,,2020-06-27T16:25:23.137,3,,"There are a ton of cocktails that mix tequila and coffee. There are three options for the coffee part of it: canned/bottled, liquor/liqueur, and home brewed/coffee house. Home brewed coffee is fun for experimentation and there are a lot of variables to work with. Coffee has three different growing regions, different roasts, and brewing methods. These things matter very much and make it hard to balance for a cocktail. Keep this in mind when you have a terrible cocktail with home-brewed coffee in it, a different coffee may turn it into something wonderful. Honestly though, most people can't make a good cup of coffee as it is. If you do make a hot coffee destined for a cold cocktail, let it cool first to reduce dilution from the ice. In practice, the same challenges of using home brewed coffee apply to coffee that you get from a coffee shop.
Here are a few that use home brewed coffee:
South of No North: tequila, coffee, cynar, simple syrup, egg white. I have not had this one, but of the cocktails here it's the one I'm most interested in. Cynar is an amaro, a bitter liqueur, made with artichoke. If you've never had an amaro, I would try a few at the bar before buying a bottle. A lot of people don't like them the first time around, ease into it with maybe Amaro Meletti and club soda.
Jalisco Martini: tequila, espresso, and coffee liquor. This is simplest of them all, most in line with what you're looking for. A single shot of espresso should be about one ounce, which is what's called for here. If there is a good coffee house around, I would order an espresso to go and take it home to mix. This recipe was adapted from a recipe by two of the founders of Altos tequila. Feel free to swap Altos, or any tequila, for the Patron which is called for. Patron supports the site author. You can also swap in Kahlua for the coffee liquor for something a little sweeter.
But First, Coffee: tequila, espresso, coffee liqueur, and a spiced coca-cola reduction. This is a sponsored post by a coffee liqueur brand, but it's a good brand. Also, I really like coffee and coke mixed together so this is my kind of thing.
Spiked Horchata: tequila, espresso, Kahlua, almond milk, and agave syrup. From the Kahlua website. Generally, if it's called for Kahlua is not interchangeable with other coffee liquors as it has rum and vanilla that make it unique.  The recipe calls for &quot;Olmeca&quot;. We can assume &quot;Olmeca&quot; is Altos tequila, probably blanco or reposado. Olmeca Altos tequila is owned by the same parent company as Kahlua, which is the only reason they call for it so, swap it out at will.
Canned or bottled coffees are a little easier to work with than homemade coffee. It's more consistent and easier to swap out. There are a ton of options to choose from though so, when a specific brand isn't called for, there's still some experimentation involved.
Coffee Margarita: tequila, cold brew, Kahlua, lime juice. This sounds... horrifying. It's from the Kahlua website. I'd only give it a try if I already had the ingredients on hand, and I wanted a good laugh. But it could be good, I've never tried it so what do I know?
Mixing coffee drinks is at its most straightforward when they only call for coffee liquors/liqueurs. There are fewer brands to choose from, you'll find a specific brand called for or you'll have a personal favorite. A lot of brands are interchangeable, though some are higher quality than others.
IMO: mezcal, shochu, coffee liquor. Mezcal is related to tequila, like the relationship between Scotch and whisky. Tequila is regulated, it can only be made with blue agave and can only be made in a handful of regions. Mezcal can be made from any number of agave varietals. Shochu is a japanese liquor, in this case made from sweet potato. This is different than what you're looking for, very little coffee here. I include it because this is a super interesting cocktail.
Hot Tamale: tequila, Kahlua, hot sauce. If you thought it couldn't get worse than dumping a bunch of lime juice into your coffee, you can dump a bunch of hot sauce into your coffee. The only coffee here is from the Kahlua, which has very little caffeine in it. There are still other tequila and Kahlua drinks are their website, which I mention for anyone just looking for that coffee &amp; tequila flavor.

This association is for a good reason though, bourbon gets it's name from a county in Kentucky. After bourbon's creation, there is a long history of it being made elsewhere around the country, but after a bourbon market crash in the 1970's, the remaining distillers, with the exception of one, were all in Kentucky. That's no longer the case but, it created the impression that all bourbon comes from Kentucky. Tennessee has Tennessee whiskey, which is basically bourbon made in Tennessee. People often associate Tennessee whiskey with the 'sour mash' process, where some mash is taken from the last batch and used in the new batch. The association between sour mash and Tennessee whiskey is mostly because of labeling and advertising, most bourbons also use a sour mash. Easily the most famous whiskey from Tennessee, Jack Daniels, is labelled as Tennessee whiskey. This has created an even larger distinction, in the minds of the public, between bourbon and Tennessee whiskey. The difference between the two really boils down to regional pride.

I tried to find a site that could standardize this question and this is what I came up with the following. If it does not truly answer your question, it is definitely helpful. Please remember to follow the links.

Beer Tasting 101
It can be as easy as taking the time to notice the flavours in every beer you drink. Here are a few general rules to keep in mind:

Make sure your beer isn’t too cold.

If a beer is very cold, it is a lot harder to taste. It’s a good idea to pull your beer out of the fridge 15 minutes early (or you can always take your time drinking it!)

Always pour the beer into a glass.

This releases the aromas, as well as the CO2, and will make it a lot easier to taste the full flavour of the beer.

Relax and Enjoy:

Taking a moment to smell your beer and linger on your first sip will make every beer a rewarding experience.
Taste and Savour
This section outlines basic beer-tasting technique, and what to look for. The Beerology™beer evaluation sheet provides some helpful guidelines and terminology, and can be downloaded to have beer-tasting sessions at home, at the pub, or to record personal impressions.
Appearance
Raise your glass, and take a moment to appreciate the appearance of the beer in front of you. Although colour and clarity aren’t necessarily an indication of the beer’s quality, the look of any given beer was crafted intentionally and is an integral part of the drinking experience. The colour chart on the Beerology™beer evaluation sheet provides common beer colour descriptors. The clarity of a beer can vary from brilliant to cloudy. Head can tell you a bit more about the beer. Beers that aren’t extreme in their alcohol content should have good head retention (the foam doesn’t collapse immediately). Head retention often indicates a well-crafted beer, made with quality ingredients. As you drink your beer, look for lace-like pattern (left by the foam) on the sides of your glass. This is known as Belgian lace and is another indication of good quality.
Aroma
Smelling your beer is one of the most important steps in beer tasting. Our sense of smell informs the way we taste things, opening up a complexity of flavours to the palate. If the beer has no discernable aroma, agitate it by swirling it around in your glass. This will release some carbonation, which will carry the aroma up to your nose. It is always easiest to start with a general impression: how intense is the aroma? Is it sweet (malt aroma), sharp (hop aroma), or a balance of different notes? If you like, you can then take the time to identify more specific aromas in the beer. The Beerology™beer evaluation sheet provides some common aroma descriptors. Of course, it is always important to note whether you like the aroma of the beer or not!
Flavour
The flavour of a beer should be a natural continuation of the aroma. There are a few added dimensions that will appear, most notably bitterness. Swirl the beer around in your mouth before swallowing it. Take a note of any flavours you taste, compare these flavours to other flavours you know. Does this beer remind you of anything? If you like, take a look at the Beerology™beer evaluation sheet and see if the beer contains any of the common beer characters listed. Again, it is helpful to note the intensity of the flavour, the balance between sweetness and bitterness, and your general impressions.
Mouthfeel
Another component of flavour is mouthfeel. Mouthfeel refers to the texture and weight of the beer, as opposed to the actual taste. High alcohol beer can have a warming quality, not unlike hard alcohol, while bitter beers can sometimes be astringent. The weight, or body, of beer can also vary from being light and watery, to being full and heavy. Another interesting thing to notice is the carbonation level, since it varies between different beers. Ask yourself: is this carbonation level pleasant or distracting?
Finish
The final component of flavour is finish. Take a moment to pause between sips. Does the flavour of the beer linger, or is the finish short? The after-taste can be sweet or bitter, and can take on many flavours, either in succession or all at once. Also notice the intensity of the finish. The finish of a beer depends greatly on the style in which it is brewed. The most important thing to note is: do you want to take another sip?
General Impression
Having taken a few moments to appreciate the various aspects of the beer in front of you, it is always a good idea to summarize your impressions of the beer. Were the flavours really lively and well balanced, or did they fall flat? Did the beer have a very fresh quality to it, or do you suspect that it was stale? Finally, take a moment to decide how much you liked the beer. Just because it was very flavourful and fresh, doesn’t mean that it was to your taste! Feel free to take more notes and share your impressions with friends.

That’s what you called “spongelike texture”. To safeguard against this avoid mixing cream liqueurs with high-acid mixers such as citrus juices and soft drinks (most soft drinks do not taste sour, but they do contain high levels of citric and phosphoric acids and they have the same effect due to the pH levels).   
If you enjoy a mixed drink with cream liqueurs try coffee, hot chocolate, other cream liqueurs, or milkshake-style cocktails (in which the dairy enhances the smooth mouthfeel of the ice cream). Cream liqueurs are also delicious served alone on the rocks.

So, this is a bit of a tricky question to answer and entirely depends on what kind of data you're looking to extract. There's a lot of different data that could be extracted from different resources.

Item name
Barcode
Price
Size
Description
Tasting notes
Region (it was created)
Alcohol percentage
Wine scores
Awards
Grape variety
Winery
User reviews (from whatever API you are using)
Etc. etc.

It should also be noted that the values are entirely different, based on the vintage of the wine that is selected. Simply going by barcode won't help, as many wineries use the same barcode across multiple vintages.
There then comes the question -- what price are you trying to display? Do you want to show which locations nearby you can buy the product and their prices? Or are you trying to display the wholesaler pricing? From my experience, wholesalers will generally withhold this kind of information.
As far as wine-searcher.com, their data seems pretty good for the most part but according to their API developers page, it doesn't include everything I mentioned above. Going through wine-searcher also means 2 different APIs (Price Check API &amp; Marketplace API), and you'd have to pay for each.
A lot of the other so-called &quot;open source wine databases&quot; online aren't kept up-to-date and don't contain much information. You could try contacting those in charge of CellarTracker, but I'm not sure if they have an API for use to the public.

Your question is pretty open-ended, but I think the data you are looking for (in relation to wine-searcher) would be found here. But once again, you're going to have to pay based on the amount of queries you are doing per day.

Well that will have to depend on the person!
Alcohol seems to be able to work as an aphrodisiac. However, it is strongly recommended not to have more than a drink or two at most. More than that and any alcoholic drink may have a bad affect on one’s sex life.

Effects in females
It increases sexual desire — sort of
A drink or two may boost arousal, but it’s not a sure bet.
Drinking alcohol increases testosterone levels in females. This male sex hormone plays a role in sexual desire. It may be a factor in females reporting more sexual desire when drinking.
There’s also an element of expectation. People often associate drinking with lowered inhibitions and feeling sexier and more confident. It’s kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy: If you expect to get lucky when you’re drinking, you probably will.
It can increase and decrease sexual arousal
Some females may have more interest in sex when they’ve had a few drinks, but that doesn’t mean their bodies are going to be into it. - Here’s What Happens When You Mix Booze with Sex

Men should make sure not to over drink.

Effects in males
The effects of alcohol on males are a bit more straightforward.
Getting hard might be difficult
Yep, “whiskey dick” is a thing. And it’s not just whiskey that’s to blame. Any alcoholic beverage can do it. - Here’s What Happens When You Mix Booze with Sex

For the ladies, red wine causes the sex drive to be even more pronounced than with other drinks, at least according to a group of Italian researchers who discovered that the compounds in the wine actually enhance levels of sexual desire in the fairer sex. What the researchers uncovered was that the red wine specifically increased blood flow to women’s erogenous areas, which in turn led to increased levels of desire. The researchers were quick to point out, however, that after more than a drink or two the other effects of alcohol began to take hold, which led to a less pleasurable experience. Moderation, it seems, is key.
For those a little more adventurous, here are nine aphrodisiac cocktails to spice up your night:

Casino Royale
Chili Martini
Ginseng Ginger Spritz
The Chocolate Rye
Gin cocktail with honey and lemon cordial
Spiced Manhattan Cocktail
Gingered Peach Margarita
Brandy Alexander
Muscadet wine with oysters

All said and done, there is no one liquor, liqueur, wine or any other alcoholic drink is the best aphrodisiac on the market. However, red wine seems best for the ladies.
To enhance the the mood, I would recommend some high end chocolates for the ladies.
Just keep in mind, that a drink or two seems to be the best. More than that can make the affects of the alcohol in one’s system can backfire.

I understand the recipes of making Kykeon, but am at a loss as to what modern wine would be considered as a close substitute.

Kykeon was an Ancient Greek drink of various descriptions. Some were made mainly of water, barley and naturally occurring substances. Others were made with wine and grated cheese. It is widely believed that kykeon usually refers to a psychoactive compounded brew, as in the case of the Eleusinian Mysteries. A kykeon was used at the climax of the Eleusinian Mysteries to break a sacred fast, but it is also mentioned as a favourite drink of Greek peasants.
It was supposed to have digestive properties: In Aristophanes' Peace Hermes recommends it to the hero who ate too much dry fruit and nuts.
Aristocrats shunned it as a peasant drink: Theophrastus' Characters depicts a peasant who goes to the Ecclesia drunk with kykeon.

The recipe I am going to use is not magical in any sense of the imagination and will be made with ordinary ingredients.

Lesbos wine is wine made on the Greek island of Lesbos in the Aegean Sea. The island has a long history of winemaking dating back to at least the 7th century BC when it was mentioned in the works of Homer. During this time the area competed with the wines of Chios for the Greek market. An apocryphal account details one of the brothers of the poet Sappho as a merchant trading Lesbos wine with the Greek colony of Naucratis in Egypt. The most noted Lesbos wine was known as Pramnian which draws similarities today to the Hungarian wine Eszencia. The popularity of Lesbos wine continued into Roman times where it was highly valued along with other Aegean wines of Chios, Thasos and Kos.
Other types of Pramnian
While Lesbos is considered by some scholars to be the main source of Pramnian, there is association of the name with wines from Smyrna and Icaria. The Greek writer Athenaeus used the term in almost a generic way to refer to any dark, long lived wine of good quality. Athenaeus's description also paints a different description than of a Tokay-like wine, instead of a wine that is dry and very strong. The resulting grape must be very high in sugar and even after a brief fermentation period it still retains high residual levels and creates a viscous, honeyed sweet wine.

The recipe I will use is based on this YouTube video: Kykeon: The Drink of Greek Heroes

Beer snobs are going to look down on something like Sapporo, but it's okay to like what you like. What I might caution is that craft breweries are likely to make beer with stronger flavors than a mass market lager. As you get more experience with beer it is quite possible your tastes will evolve. One reason to like beer is that there are so many styles. While you might like lagers, it would be good to stretch you experience to other styles.  A really good resource is Beer Advocate. You can get descriptions of different beer styles and rankings within styles.
As for Northern California, I have limited experience. One brewery I have been to is Russian River Brewing in Santa Rosa. They make a vast array of beers including the best IPA I've ever had. Most craft breweries offer &quot;flights&quot; which are a series of small pours (3 or 4 ounces). This allows you to try different beer varieties without committing to an entire glass.

The Greek study tool online from Tufts defines Pramnian as &quot;raisin-wine&quot; which is too interpretive since other descriptions are are of a dark, dry, strong wine that is not not necessarily pleasurable.
My approach is to try both.  I went to my local Total Wine store with the largest selection and to their Greek wine section. Pramnian is definitely red and they had four.  One was a retsina which was not a style in Homer's day.  The other three were two dry table wines and a sweeter red for about $10 each.  I got all three. I told the wine clerk what I was doing and he recommended a good quality dry Sardinian red (Dolia) since the volcanic soil where it's grown resembles what would be found in Lesbos. I will start experimenting this week. I may even infuse the wine with herbs like mint and oregano to get to something like a vermouth. I'm using pearl barley, raw yellow honey, and a couple goat cheese varieties (from a fresher chevre, to a drunken goat, to an unpasteurized hard Spanish goat cheese).  My guess is following the recipe will result in a pretty unpalatable concoction but I will deviate as much as I need to until I get to something I like, probably like a goat cheese barley-polenta with onion and red wine.

8142,2,,2020-09-14T14:13:09.770,2,,"Can a liquor be both a vodka and whisky? What's the difference?
The short answer is yes.
Here is what Wikipedia has to say about what constitutes a liquor.

Liquor (also hard liquor, hard alcohol, distilled alcohol, fire water, or spirit water) is an alcoholic drink produced by distillation of grains, fruits, or vegetables that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation. The distillation process purifies the liquid and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its proportion of alcohol content (commonly expressed as alcohol by volume, ABV).1 As liquors contain significantly more alcohol than other alcoholic drinks, they are considered &quot;harder&quot; – in North America, the term hard liquor is used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones, whereas the term spirits is used in the UK. Brandy is a liquor produced by the distillation of wine, and has an ABV of over 35%. Other examples of liquors include vodka, baijiu, shōchū, soju, gin, rum, tequila, mezcal, and whisky. (Also see list of alcoholic drinks, and liquors by national origin.)
The term does not include alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, mead, sake, huangjiu or cider, as they are fermented, not distilled. These all have a relatively low alcohol content, typically less than 15%. Nor does it include wine based products fortified with spirits, such as port, sherry or vermouth.
There is no evidence for a health benefit for liquor at any level of consumption. Compared to other types of alcohol, excess consumption of liquor is more strongly associated with harmful health effects.

The mixing of mash ingredients that would traditionally constitute two different type of liquors would still be considered a liquor as long as it is properly distilled after fermentation has occurred.
The mixing of two different types of liquors use still constitute a liquor by principle, such as vodka and whiskey, but would in general be called a cocktail.
However a drink mixed with a liquor and another alcoholic beverage that is simply fermented and not distilled is no longer a liquor but a cocktail

So, the question if something can be a whisky and vodka at the same time, can definitely be answered with yes.
If you look into grain destillated spirit (in scotland, for example), there is grain whisky. It is made from other grains than malted barley (but can contain this as well, but it's more expensive) and is usually distilled in a coloumn still. This is pretty much the same production method as a grain made vodka. And when you mature it in a cask for 3 years, you could either call it a grain whisky, or a cask aged vodka.

Fortified wine glasses come in a variety of shapes these days and are constantly being updated.

There are as many different styles of glassware as wine styles these days, but which glass is best to use for fortified wines? There are many options but most likely you will have a suitable glass tucked away somewhere in your cupboard… possible next to an old fortified wine forgotten! Get both out and give them a try, you may be surprised!
Fortified wines deserve a large glass that allows you to swirl and smell the wine. These wines have amazing aromas and depths of flavour so allowing the wine to concentrate these flavours in the glass will only add to your enjoyment of the wine. We recommend a good sized wine glass with a rounded body and slightly tapered sides towards the top.  This will allow for swirling will minimal chance of spill and more importantly get your nose in for a good sniff to experience all the wine has to offer. Using a larger sized glass also allows you a generous sized pour you can sit down, relax and enjoy your wine. Don’t feel tempted to fill it to the top though, a good splash you can swirl about is all you need.
For entertainment at a dinner party you may wish to consider port sippers. These little hand-blown glasses look similar to a headless cat with a round body and a tail running the side. There is some merit to these in that while holding the glass you hands warm up the wine and helping release more flavour. They also make a loud slurping sound as you sip your glass entertaining your guests and signifying the bottle/decanter may need to be returned in that direction for a refill.
So put away the old style thimbles and get yourself a decent size glass, pour, swirl and savour the flavours of your fortified wines! - which Wine Glass?

The problem I'm looking at is my step-father has an impressive cellar, but some of the wines are rather aged. I think last Christmas we had a couple bottles of 1982 Château Lafite Rothschild or similar. I have no idea why he would waste that bottle of wine on my plebeian tastes, but he does.
The problem is the corks are really starting to go (the bottom of the cork is breaking down, but not rotten). He will spend about 30 minutes finessing the wine key (corkscrew) into the cork and wrestling it out. Invariably, the bottom of the cork will break and fall into the bottle. It doesn't affect drinkability, but we have to hear him rant about it until he's fished every piece of cork out before pouring into the decanter.
I thought about getting him a gas injection wine opener. It looks like most of these are based on nitrous oxide or argon gas, which wouldn't affect the wine in any way.
My question is: Would the needle used to inject the gas into the bottle be able to penetrate the cork but at the same time not break out the bottom of the cork that's in the condition I've described. Or, are these contraptions just gimmicks for the plebs like me?

8160,2,,2020-09-25T15:48:18.417,1,,"Why do you call some wines by region and other wines by grapes varietal?
There are several factors to be taken into consideration here. First of all, let us start with the definition of what a grape varietal is.

A varietal wine is a wine made primarily from a single named grape variety, and which typically displays the name of that variety on the wine label. Examples of grape varieties commonly used in varietal wines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Merlot. Wines that display the name of two or more varieties on their label, such as a Chardonnay-Viognier, are blends and not varietal wines. The term is frequently misused in place of vine variety; the term variety refers to the vine or grape while varietal refers to the wine produced by a variety.
As vintners and consumers have become aware of the characteristics of individual varieties of wine grapes, wines have also come to be identified by varietal names.
The term was popularized in the US by Maynard Amerine at the University of California, Davis after Prohibition seeking to encourage growers to choose optimal vine varieties, and later promoted by Frank Schoonmaker in the 1950s and 1960s, ultimately becoming widespread during the California wine boom of the 1970s. Varietal wines are commonly associated with New World wines in general, but there is also a long-standing tradition of varietal labelling in Germany and other German-influenced wine regions including Austria, Alsace, and the Czech Republic. - Varietal

Wine region as such generally are those regions which have had some amount of known historical wine making in their past and thus are more well know as such.
The usage of these terms seems to have several factors involved in why we call them as such.

Unlike American wines, most European wines are named for the region where their grapes grow rather than for the grape variety itself. Many of these European wines come from precisely the same grape varieties as American wines (like Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc, and so on), but they don’t say so on the label. Instead, the labels say Burgundy, Bordeaux, Sancerre, and so on: the place where those grapes grow.
Why name a wine after a place?
Grapes, the raw material of wine, have to grow somewhere. Depending on the type of soil, the amount of sunshine and rain, and the many other characteristics that each somewhere has, the grapes will turn out differently. If the grapes are different, the wine is different. Each wine, therefore, reflects the place where its grapes grow.
In Europe, grape growers/winemakers have had centuries to figure out which grapes grow best where. They’ve identified most of these grape-location matchups and codified them into regulations. Therefore, the name of a place where grapes are grown in Europe automatically connotes the grape (or grapes) used to make the wine of that place. The label on the bottle usually doesn’t tell you the grape (or grapes), though.
The terroir game
*Terroir is a French word that has no direct translation in English, so wine people just use the French word, for expediency. Terroir has no fixed definition; it’s a concept, and people tend to define it more broadly or more narrowly to suit their own needs. The word itself is based on the French word terre, which means soil; so some people define terroir as, simply, dirt.
But terroir is really much more complex (and complicated) than just dirt. Terroir is the combination of immutable natural factors — such as topsoil, subsoil, climate (patterns of sun, rain, wind, and so on), the slope of the hill, and altitude — that a particular vineyard site has. Chances are that no two vineyards in the entire world have precisely the same combination of these factors. So terroir is considered to be the unique combination of natural factors that a particular vineyard site has.
Terroir is the guiding principle behind the European concept that wines should be named after the place they come from. The thinking goes like this: The name of the place connotes which grapes were used to make the wine of that place (because the grapes are set by regulations), and the place influences the character of those grapes in its own unique way.
Therefore, the most accurate name that a wine can have is the name of the place where its grapes grew. It’s not some nefarious plot; it’s just a whole different way of looking at things. Understanding Wine Names by Region

How about a Mahogany cocktail!

Mahogany is a dark drink whose traditional recipe is 2 parts of gin to 1 part of treacle. It was drunk by active outdoorsmen such as Cornish fisherman and Canadian lumberjacks.

Why a mahagoni drink one may ask? Black treacle was once believe to cure the Black Plague.

Treacle—a by-product of sugar production—would often be given to sick patients. Unfortunately, it had to be at least ten years old to be considered effective. The old, smelly, sticky substance was believed to combat not only the horrific effects of the disease, but to rid the body of it for good.
This remedy actually has a touch of sense to it: potentially disease-fighting moulds, yeasts and other cultures would have thrived in the syrup and matured over time. But we can only wonder who thought of this in the first place, and how on earth the victims managed to swallow. - 10 Crazy Cures for the Black Death


Tate &amp; Lyle's Black Treacle
Beer steins were created to protect people from dirty insects during the Black Plague. Why not make it historically interesting at the same time. Any beer in a beer stein goes good with the pandemic atmosphere at the present moment.

Beer stein an invention caused by the bubonic plague
Who would think that the bubonic plague, flies and beer steins would have anything in common? As the adage says, &quot;Invention is the mother of necessity.&quot;
Some 500 years ago Europe was inundated with swarms of flies during the summer months. This combined with memories of the plague called for some sort of action by citizens.
By the 1500s folks in Germany had figured out that the plague had taken fewer victims in areas that adhered to certain hygienic standards. Cleanliness made a difference in who lived and who died so laws were passed to encourage citizens to leave their filthy ways to the past. One of those laws was that all food and beverage containers had to have lids to protect people from dirty insects.
Covered containers were just a small part of the movement to clean up the community. Another law required that beer could only be made from hops, cereals, yeast and water. This allowed for a better quality beer and did away with the recipes that made beer from rotten bread and such.
Long story short is that the beer industry took off in Germany and has never looked back. The covered beer stein was one innovation that took the fancy of the population long after the threat of disease had passed. The upper class would have had their beer steins made from pewter but the commoner would have embraced those made of pottery. Other mediums used would have included ivory, porcelain, wood, silver and more. Everyone would have had their own individual stein and some of them could be right fancy. All sorts of designs from coats of arms to biblical scenes have turned up on the outside of these steins.

Basically all the sources claim that the preferable way to chill champagne is a bucket filled 50/50 with cold water and ice and say that it takes 15-20 minutes to chill the bottle in this scenario - yet, the freezer method, which they say would take 10-15 minutes, is presented as a big faux pas because it kills carbonation and thus some taste values - which is a bit peculiar considering those timeframes are... well... the same.

The problem with a freezer is that if its cold enough the champagne could conceivably freeze and break the bottle. A water bucket is guaranteed no to do this so its safer. Another technique is to add salt to the ice water bath. This is supposed to speed the cooling to less than 10 minutes.

I still struggle to see this as beer, as although it has not been distilled in the standard sense it has still gone through a distillation process.

This is where the wine is slowly poured into a container (a decanter) while observing the sediment, usually with a bright light behind the bottle. The idea is to stop pouring just before the sediment escapes. You lose some liquid in the process. I suppose you could try pouring through a coffee filter too. Once decanted the wine should probably be drunk within a day or two.
Fine wine is often aged for 30 years, but it is very likely the wine is spoiled or at least well past its prime. The alcohol in the wine should keep it safe to drink, but since it was home made I can only speculate about that.

First of all, let us define what drinking in moderation is.
Caveat: This question deals only with possible health benefits! There remains always some risks in drinking alcohol even moderately, which I am not dealing with here.

Defining moderate
Moderate alcohol use for healthy adults generally means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.
Examples of one drink include:

Beer: 12 fluid ounces (355 milliliters)

Wine: 5 fluid ounces (148 milliliters)

Distilled spirits (80 proof): 1.5 fluid ounces (44 milliliters)



Eating a healthy diet and being physically active also has a great impact on one’s health benefits. So any moderate drinking should been seen in light of one’s general way of life at the time.
Some possible health benefits of moderate drinking are:

Reducing your risk of developing and dying of heart disease (1)
Possibly reducing your risk of ischemic stroke (when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow) (1)
Possibly reducing your risk of diabetes (1)
Red Wine Can Actually Burn Fat (2)
Alcohol Can Help Fight Colds (2)
Red Wine is Beneficial to Your Heart (2)
Drinking Moderately Can Improve Sexual Function in Men (2)
And for Women, It Offers Libido-Boosting Powers (2)
Red Wine Can Boost Your Memory (2)
Wine Can Make You Live Longer (2)
Vino Can Boost Your Vaccine's Effects (2)

I can tell you that in the case of brown spirits, whiskey (including subsets like bourbon) and cognac (or in most cases anything aged in high quality wood) the best producers never add sugar.  In almost all cases, the legal standards forbid it.  The fine taste and smoothness has to do somewhat with quality of raw grain material, and very much with distilling methods (and therefore much higher expense) and the aging wood itself.  The best brown spirits producers highly distill their raw spirit (clear without color off the distilling process) that removes a very high amount of fusil oils.  Fusil oils are a bad bunch of chemicals that even include benzine.  These quality producers have a lower yield of liquid that others include in their spirits. This makes the raw alcohol coming off the stills more expensive.  Getting a distillate like this is called a &quot;narrow cut&quot; - retaining only the purist of the distillates.  Won't go into it here.  The second most important thing is the quality of the wood in which they age the liquid.  One company I am intimately familiar with pays 900 Euros for their barrels while most pay 90 USD.  Now 90 USD wood is excellent but only if you are experts in wood buying and many pay in between 90 and 900.  This is why great liquids taste smooth, are complex and leave no hangover (no fusil oils that are the hangover culprit).
Finally, some inferior Russian vodkas add a very small amount of sugar to make them &quot;smoother&quot;  Its not legal but they do.  And they are expensive some of them.  But high quality producers of pure clear alcohol from which is made gin, vodka and is the base for other drinks are also very high quality and exclude as most all fusil oils.  They cost more, and it's worth it for your heath - most have no sugar added.
Finally, remember that a high amount of sugar combined with alcohol (think cocktails) can produce hellatious hangovers because high sugar with low quality alcohol makes for a bad Saturday morning.
Hope this helps the discussion.

8213,2,,2020-12-13T17:10:01.453,2,,"One idea may be to make an affogato with the liquor poured on a mild-taste ice cream portion, for example cream (fior di latte) or custard ice cream.

An affogato or more traditionally known as &quot;affogato al caffe&quot; (Italian for &quot;drowned&quot;) is an Italian coffee-based dessert. It usually takes the form of a scoop of fior di latte or vanilla gelato or ice cream topped or &quot;drowned&quot; with a shot of hot espresso. Some variations also include a shot of amaretto, Bicerin, Kahlua, or other liqueur.
Variety of Affogato
Though restaurants and cafes in Italy categorize the affogato as a dessert, some restaurants and cafes outside of Italy categorize it as a beverage. Whether a dessert or beverage, restaurants and cafes usually serve the affogato in a tall narrowing glass, allowing the fior di latte, vanilla gelato, or ice cream melt and combine with espresso into the hollowed space in the bottom of the glass. Occasionally, coconut, berries, honeycomb and multiple flavors of ice cream are added. A biscotti or cookie can also be served and enjoyed along side this beverage. Affogatos are often enjoyed as a post-meal coffee dessert combo eaten and or drank with a spoon or straw.
While the recipe of the affogato is more or less standard in Italy, consisting of a scoop of vanilla gelato topped with a shot of espresso, variations exist in European and American restaurants.
In French, it is known as &quot;gelato al fior di latte&quot; with the translation to English &quot;flower of milk&quot;. Typically the ingredients in the ice cream includes dairy, starch, and sugar. It is popular in countries where they dress it with chocolate syrup, cantuccini, or biscotti to provide extra flavors.


Now one proper recipe! For four cups.

4 egg yolks
4 spoons of sugar
2 spoons of flour
2 spoons of potato starch
700 ml of milk
100 ml of Nanaimo Bar Cream
cocoa powder

Meanwhile milk gets to boiling temperature in a pan, beat properly the yolks with the sugar, then add the flour, the starch and stir and mix well. Then add the Nanaimo Bar Cream to the mixture. Pour the mixture in the milk pan on low heat and carry on stirring until the cream get dense.
Pour into four cups and cool at room temperature first, then in the fridge. When cooled, sprinkle cocoa and serve!

8215,2,,2020-12-14T21:32:21.983,3,,"Why have craft beers increased in alcohol content?
From my point of view there seems to be at least three reasons for this trend.

Beer drinkers are drawn to the bolder flavors and the mouth feel of stronger beers.
The higher alcohol content gives such beers a longer shelf life.
Stronger beers do not have to be served at cooler temperatures as lighter beers, some can be served somewhat warm.
Part of craft beer's popularity is in its variety, including high ABV beers.


What is driving the popularity of high alcohol beers, and will it last?
With the surge in popularity of craft beers, the alcohol content in a good many of them has also risen. While most large breweries turn out beer with an ABV (alcohol by volume) around 4 to 5 percent, some craft beers boast ABV counts of up to 29 percent, with the average being 5.9 percent.
The American IPA trend among craft brewers exploits this proclivity toward higher alcohol content, with most being between 6 and 10 percent. Double and triple IPAs are even higher. Most craft brewers now have at least one higher ABV variety, and much of it has been driven by consumer demand.
Why do consumers like higher alcohol beers?
Much of the appeal has to do with taste. Higher ABV beers tend to have a richer, more complex taste that can sometimes be on the bitter side. Fans are drawn to the bolder flavors and the mouth feel of these stronger beers, some of which may be barrel-aged like stronger spirits. Instead of having three or four beers, they may share one with a friend to compensate for its strength.
The popularity of higher ABV beers persists in spite of their steeper price tag. A decanter bottle of Sam Adams Utopia, with an ABV of 29 percent, can cost as much as $200. Another factor in popularity with both brewers and drinkers is that the higher alcohol content gives it a longer shelf life. Either way, consumers tend to identify beers with higher ABV as being higher quality.

My guess is that one could try a red wine like Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. Generally speaking they are dry and thus not sweet.

Red Wine Sweetness Chart
Some Chardonnays may in fact be buttery, but not all.

What does the term “buttery” mean in reference to wine?
&quot;Buttery&quot; can refer to a flavor, smell, texture or some combination of all three, and it's most commonly associated with Chardonnay. Buttery flavors usually come from diacetyl, an organic compound that’s a natural byproduct of fermentation. Diacetyl can also be a result of putting a wine through a malolactic conversion. Exposing a wine to oak barrels can also emphasize buttery notes—both from the toasting on the inside of the barrel, and the softening effect barrels can have on a wine’s texture.
Have you ever smelled a wine and it’s a dead ringer for butter-flavored popcorn? That’s not a coincidence. Diacetyl is sometimes added to foods for its buttery flavor—think movie-theater popcorn, margarine, crackers and cooking oil.
I consider “buttery” a positive note. Just like any other wine characteristic, I prefer it in balance with a wine’s other elements. But buttery Chardonnays used to be very fashionable, and now much less so. These days, sometimes “buttery” is used as a pejorative term.
Other descriptors in a similar vein are cream/creamy, piecrust, caramel, butterscotch or brioche.

While there may be some spirits that may be okay to mix almost all spirits have distinct differences between brands.
Vodka: if you have plain vodkas, designed to have as little taste as possible, and just add alcohol to fruit juices etc, these will be good to mix. I would not suggest doing this with for example a Stolichnaya, or Bison, or other distinct vodka, or with any flavoured vodkas.
Gin: you really cannot mix gins, as they all have very different flavours from the mix of botanicals. In fact that is the whole point of keeping multiple bottles.
Tequila: Unless you have really cheap tequila (the kind you use for shots and hide the taste with salt/lemon) they all have distinct tastes, and it would be a shame to mix them - they all make different margaritas, for example.
Rum: again, even within the main groups of dark, light, overproof, spiced, navy etc you have a multitude of flavours, so mixing these will dilute the very notes they are famed for.
Bourbon: between bourbons, Kentucky whiskey, Tennessee whiskey and others, there are huge differences in sweetness, smokiness and other notes. These are also a no-no for mixing.
Also, don't even think about doing this with whisky
To answer your specific questions:

you'll take away the flavours
it's perfectly safe
they will taste different, but depending on the mixers and your guests' palates, that may be a good or bad thing
if you mix equal quantities, the new alcohol level will be the average of the two

The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.

The distillation process was little known and used in Europe during the Middle Ages. Wine was was distilled into brandy as early as 1313 but it was prepared only as a medicine and was considered as possessing such marvelous strengthening and sanitary powers that the physicians named it “the water of life,” (l’eau de vie) a name it still retains.
The Late Medieval Period is generally considered from 1300-1500.

The first years of the 14th century were marked by famines, culminating in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures
These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe during the following three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, about one-third of the population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. - Late Middle Ages

Thus bringing everything into perspective, it is easy to see how distilled wine (brandy) would naturally have been used as a medicine back in the day, rather than an outright popular drink.

Brandy began to be distilled in France circa 1313, but it was prepared only as a medicine and was considered as possessing such marvelous strengthening and sanitary powers that the physicians named it “the water of life,” (l’eau de vie) a name it still retains.
In the young America Colonies, George Washington began commercial distilling in 1797 at the urging of his Scottish farm manager, James Anderson, who had experience distilling grain in Scotland. With this experienced help, Washington became one of the largest distillers in young America with five copper stills operating 12 months a year. However, a few years earlier, Laird’s America had opened (making it the oldest apple brandy producer) and began distilling applejack and brandy in 1780. The abundance of naturally available fruits for processing as compared to the labor-intensive planting and harvesting of grains resulted in young America’s practical adaptation of the readily available harvest of local fruits.

The first recorded account for whiskey was in 1495. Certainly, it had been around before then.
It seems logical to presume that brandy was the most common hard liquor in the Late Middle Ages. It was in any case more widespread throughout Europe during this time frame.

This is probably the closest to what you're looking.
Outside of 'clear' vodkas, there's a whole huge range of flavored vodkas that are given a wild variety of flavor through additions, infusions and other processes - next to more common tastes like cherry, lemon, chestnut or apple, you'll find bread vodka, pepper vodka, horseradish, ginger, chili, and many, many more. Zubrowka Palona is one with smoky whisky flavor - it was vodka aged in the same conditions as whisky, in charred oak barrels. The manufacturer still markets it as a flavored vodka, but at this point there's practically nothing separating it from whisky. And there's nothing that says this process can't be used to flavor vodkas. In the end - you can say every whisky is just a specific kind of flavored vodka.

Journalists do good work, however their English is not always the best. I believe the phrase should have been phrased in the following manner: A particular Boston rum (laced with whiskey).
This is easily explained seeing the slight faux pas. In this it is quite common to age rum in Boston in used whiskey barrels. Being aged in whiskey barrels would give the rum a taste as being laced with whiskey.

Bully Boy Boston Rum

Bully Boy revives flavors of the Old World with their Boston Rum.
When Bully Boy Distillery opened in Boston, Massachusetts, they felt, given that the regions’ history, it was only fitting that one of their original spirits be a craft rum. You see, dating back to the 1600s, Massachusetts’ original distilleries were famous for their rum production. At their peak, there was about sixty distilleries operating in the state. As an homage, Bully Boy created an aged rum using blackstrap molasses, for the vanilla notes it imparts, and sweet molasses, for its cleaner, fruiter flavor. The combination give Bully Boy Boston Rum a unique, nuanced flavor.
Bully Boy instills its own “house” flavor in a sort of editing process. They include more of the front end of the “run” to get more banana and pineapple notes to compliment the molasses flavors. When their done, the rum goes into whiskey barrels, where it is aged. The time it spends in the barrels mellows the rum, while adding notes of chocolate, vanilla, oak and more layers of complexity.
It took a while to perfect this recipe, but the Willis brothers knew they were on the right track when the rum started evolving its way into their father’s liquor cabinet.

8262,2,,2021-02-05T17:20:36.120,3,,"Why does the Saaz hop have a German name?
Along time back, the town of Žatec was part of Germany and not part of the now Czech Republic. Thus the name reflects an historical perspective rather than a cultural one.

Officially registered in 1952, the original Saaz, or Czech Saaz as it is sometimes known, has established itself as a staple variety for brewers and dates back more than 700 years. Originating in Zatec, Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic) it is an esteemed red-bine variety that is now grown around the world. New Zealand in particular has embraced Saaz, breeding several descendants including the popular Motueka and Riwaka varieties (B &amp; D Saaz, respectively).
Saaz is one of the four original Noble hops and has a distinctive and classic aroma. Known for its prominent use in Stella Artois and countless Bohemian Lagers and Pilsners. Its warm, herbal character stems from a high level of farnesene while its other oils are in fair balance.
With such a low alpha acid percentage, Saaz is inarguably an aroma hop, however, when used as an early addition it is thought to add a delicate bitterness. Additionally, its elevated content of polyphenols aids in abating oxidation, giving beer brewed with Saaz a notably longer shelf life.
Growing Saaz is not without its difficulties. Specifically, it endures a meager yield, has weak mildew resistance and light cones. The original Saaz variety has been successfully cloned 9 times between 1952 and 1993 in an effort to improve these factors. Originally, growers were hesitant to hybridize, fearing the loss of its signature and delicate aroma. This hybridization has become necessary though to breed resistance to wilt and mildew and make it a more viable crop. Despite these few shortcomings, breweries use it prolifically worldwide. - Saaz

Žatec and the Saaz noble hop have an interesting intermingled history.

Žatec (German: Saaz) is a town in Louny District, Ústí nad Labem Region, in the Czech Republic. It has about 19,000 inhabitants.
It is famous for an over-700-year-long tradition of growing Saaz noble hops used by several breweries. Žatec produces its own beer and hosts 'Dočesná', its hops-related harvest festival every year on the town square.
The earliest historical reference to the Bohemian fortress of Sacz is in the Latin chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg of 1004, when King Henry II of Germany reconquered it from the Polish duke Bolesław I Chrobry. During the 11th century it belonged to the Vršovci – a powerful Czech aristocratic family. It received the privileges of a royal town under King Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1265. A coat-of-arms was given to the citizens by King Vladislaus II for their courage during the storming of Milan.
From the outbreak of the Hussite Wars in 1419 to the Thirty Years' War, the town was Hussite or Protestant, but after the Battle of White Mountain (1620) the greater part of the Czech inhabitants left the town, which remained German and Roman Catholic until 1945, when the German speaking inhabitants were forced to leave their home and expelled to Germany. On June 3, 1945 about 5,000 German inhabitants were gathered on the Market place and marched to Postoloprty, where at least 763 were murdered in the Postoloprty massacre, estimates range up to 2,000 victims killed by Czechoslovak military in Žatec and on the March.
During and after the World War II a Messerschmitt production facility and air base for testing aircraft, including new jet fighters, was located close to the town. In 1948 the production facility continued to produce the Avia S-199, a version of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft which were sold to Israel, with the initial training for the Israeli pilots provided at the air base. Many other military supplies were flown to Israel from the air base, which helped the new state to secure its independence.

What is the socially acceptable tactic of consuming a layered cocktail?
That will generally depend on the type of layered cocktail one is drinking. There is generally no socially acceptable manner of consuming a layered cocktail! One is free to drink them in the manner befitting the individual.

A layered (or &quot;stacked&quot;) drink, sometimes called a pousse-café, is a kind of cocktail in which the slightly different densities of various liqueurs are used to create an array of colored layers, typically two to seven. The specific gravity of the liquid ingredients increases from top to bottom. Liqueurs with the most dissolved sugar and the least alcohol are densest and are put at the bottom. These include fruit juices and cream liqueurs. Those with the least water and the most alcohol, such as rum with 75% alcohol by volume, are floated on top.
These drinks are made primarily for visual enjoyment rather than taste. They are sipped, sometimes through a silver straw, one liqueur at a time. The drink must be made and handled carefully to avoid mixing; however, some layered drinks, such as shooters, are generally drunk quickly. - Layered drink

As for myself, layered cocktails like the B-52 or a Black and Tan are consumed as shooters.
More complex layered cocktails, I use a stainless steel straw and carefully sip one liqueur or liquor at a time. To be honest, I enjoy the individual tastes of the different liqueurs. Some liqueurs have such an overpowering flavour that they are best drunk separately.
Chartreuse, Bénédictine and Absinthe are all strongly flavoured liqueurs and would overpower any layered cocktail if mixed all together before drinking them. Ergo, I use a straw!

Generally speaking: no.
Drinking a little whiskey may be beneficial for the stomach, but would be better somewhat prior to eating.
Even St. Paul ( for those of us who are believers) tells Timothy to drink a little wine because of stomach and frequent ailments.

Stop drinking only water and use a little wine instead, because of your stomach and your frequent ailments. - 1 Timothy 5:23

Drinking in moderation is best. When I am somewhat hungry, I find that one drink will ease my stomach’s wontedness for food if drank about one half hour to an hour before I eat. That includes meat.

Especially after fatty meals, alcohol is said to promote digestion. But it seems it's not the alcohol that has a positive effect on the stomach. On the contrary: alcohol actually impedes gastric emptying. It blocks the action of nerves that are important for the transport of food in the abdomen. So high-proof alcoholic drinks are not beneficial to digestion. Herbal liqueur before a meal can be enjoyable. But here again, it's not the alcohol but the bitter substances the drink contains that stimulate the mucous membranes of the stomach to release acid. That can actually facilitate the pre-digestion of foods. The bitter substances in non-alcoholic beverages such as espresso have a similar effect. The right time for this digestive aid is about half an hour before a meal. And after you eat, a postprandial walk is better than any drink. - Does alcohol after a meal really help digestion?

The Romans had wine rations for their troops. That became rations of beer in northern countries.
Wine was give to the French troops in World War I.

It was Arnold Zweig, German anti-fascist writer and WW1 volunteer, who said that it was possible for a man to fight a war “without women, without ammunition, even without strongpoints, but not without tobacco and not at all without alcohol.”
Forces on both sides of the war appreciated this fact: for the maintenance of troop moral, alcohol had an important part to play.
And beyond the tenches, the social and cultural impact of the war would sound the beginning of the 20th Century, and with that, the cocktail boom that would help to define the inter-war years in Europe.
So, from the trenches of three of the major protagonists and two cocktail innovations that are enjoyed to this day, we have assembled the top five drinks associated with the Great War.
When France went to war in 1914, troops were only issued water, but the army quickly began issuing a daily wine ration as early as September 1914.
This consisted of Pinard (a word whose english equivalent would be “plonk”), which was a low-quality red wine. Generally, soliders were issued with ½ liter of Pinard per day, but this could fluctuate depending on the logistical situation.
Soldiers were sometimes issued beer, cider, or brandy in lieu of Pinard, but it remained the most common alcoholic drink consumed at the front.

Supply and demand for alcohol for troops will vary according to region and economic situations involved, this includes the Indian Army.

Why is liquor drinking encouraged in the Indian Armed Forces?

As others have pointed out only tax is not charged and limited supply is given.

Rationed liquor ie in small doses is good for health.

Liquor helps in relaxation and also frees mind from stress of daily hard routine.

Liquor high reduces self-censorship so that many times it allows the person to loosen up his feelings clamped up inside. This is like a release valve of pent-up stress. Within limits such regular dispersal of stress is a good thing. Though out of limits it can lead to creating situations which will actually lead to more stress. Given the strict discipline and obedience required in army it might help unwinding from stressful situations.

Why alcohol helps with stress : As per Ayurveda wine and alcohol are classified extra sweet (not in taste but in after-effect on mind and body). They bring sweet taste to life. Many times people get addicted to this sweet effect of alcohol. For example in Ayurveda alcohol addicts are advised to slowly reduce and replace alcohol with sweet smell, sweet taste, sweet music, sweet warmth, sweet emotions of love, comfort, safety and caring etc. This helps reduce the withdrawal symptoms and slowly wean away the dependence on alcohol.

It’s not very surprising that people who lead a hard and stressful life away from comforts of family and civilian life need a bit of sweetness in their life as well. It comes in a bottle and can be had in limited quantities on demand.

Not all postings are on border or troubled areas. Also not all army men are involved in military field operations as some may be in administration or teaching or other duties. Still the traditions of British times may have continued irrespective of type of work.



The Indian Army will acquire their provisions of alcohol, like all other armies, locally if possible and at the best price possible.
War is hell, and soldiers need a little lift from the misery of their life style. It is more a question of maintaining good troop moral!
The Russians love their vodka, the French their wine and the Indian troops love their rum.

An Israeli brewing company called Meadan Craft Brewing has created a beer that's totally kosher for Passover. How?

There are a number of ways to drink a Lager beer with whiskey.
Traditionally, the liquor is drunk in a single gulp and is then &quot;chased&quot; by the beer (lager or otherwise), which is sipped.
The liquor and lager may be mixed by pouring or dropping the shot into the beer. The mixture may be stirred. If the shot glass is dropped into the beer glass, the drink can also be known as a depth charge. As long as drunk in moderation even a depth charge will not kill you.
Whiskey may be poured directly into an open beer bottle or can after consuming some of the beer.

8286,2,,2021-03-01T15:15:36.570,5,,"The truth is that Tequila is a sipping alcohol, on the whole.

“In Mexico, tequila is kept in the fridge so it’s perfectly chilled
when served and almost always enjoyed neat,”

according to Angel Bolivar, the head bartender at Casa Neta in New York City.
Of course, as with any alcohol, throwing as much money at it as possible will generally get a person something that comes from the higher shelves and is 'better' and more delicious than some of its competitors. However, you never need to break the bank in order to partake in a fancy and delicious beverage.
Knowing the different types of Tequila is the best way to begin one's search... At the most basic level, there are essentially 2 types of tequila:
1.) &quot;Mixto&quot; or mixed - anything can be labeled as Tequila as long as 51% of the fermented sugars come from the Blue Agave plant. Therefore other sugars and additives, like cane sugar, caramel color, oak and other flavorings, glycerin, and sugar-based syrups, can make up the other 49%... generally any tequila labeled &quot;gold (oro)&quot; and &quot;joven (young)&quot; is going to be a mixto.
2.) 100% agave tequila - this is the stuff that you will want to sip. Leave the cocktails to the mixtos.
From there, the tequilas can be broken up into the way that they are aged. There are essentially 4 classifications of aged tequila  that is made from 100% blue agave:
1.) Blanco (white) or Silver - this would be the youngest type of tequila. The liquid is clear because it never sees the inside of a wooden cask.
2.) Reposado - means &quot;rested&quot; and is usually aged for more than a couple months and up to a year.
3.) Añejo - means &quot;vintage&quot; and is aged from one to three years.
4.) Extra Añejo - also &quot;ultra añejo,&quot; is going to be tequila aged for more than 3 years time.
I have heard recommendations that beginners should start with sipping white tequilas but, I would vehemently disagree... in my experience, the whites are more &quot;harsh&quot; and fiery. They do not have as many subtle notes or nuanced flavors before and after being in the palate. Morgan Hurley, marketing and beverage director of Mex 1 Coastal Cantina in Charleston, S.C. states;

“Blancos showcase the terroir and the agave, but they also show any
imperfections.”

TLDR: Any 100% agave tequila labeled &quot;reposado&quot; or &quot;añejo&quot; is going to be your best choice for sipping - though not mandatory, set your budget for around $30 and up for the best experience.

The short answer is yes, but it is not being sold at present. Latter half of my answer shows how to make your own palcohol at home. It is so easy, so why pay for the extras!
First of all, palcohol was created by a gentleman by the name of Mark Phillips.
The US federal government approved Palcohol on March 10, 2015 and it is now legal to be sold in the United States. However it will not be for sale immediately but possibly in late 2021 at the earliest. I doubt it will ever make it to market, but that is me.
Palcohol, when used as directed, by adding six ounces of liquid to it, is equal to a standard mixed drink.

What flavors are there? We plan on releasing five versions sold in a pouch that is the equivalent to one shot of alcohol:

V which is powder made from premium vodka distilled four times.

R which is powder made from premium Puerto Rican rum


V and R can be used two ways. One way is by adding six ounces of your favorite mixer to make a Rum and Coke, Vodka and Orange Juice, etc. Another option is adding six ounces of water to the powder and then adding a flavored drink powder to make it any flavor you want. The result is equivalent to one average mixed drink.
The three cocktail versions are:

Cosmopolitan

Powderita - tastes just like a Margarita

Lemon Drop


Just add water to these three flavors for an instant cocktail. - Palcohol is Powered Alcohol

Mark Philips from Scottsdale, AZ. explains what palcohol is in his YouTube video: The Truth About Palcohol
Addendum:
You can always make your own. It is so simple you do not need to wait any longer!
On Popular Science's website, Paul Adams wrote that he didn’t know how Palcohol did it but he explained how he could make powdered alcohol at home using a specially modified starch - a maltodextrin made from tapioca and sold under the brand name N-Zorbit M.

In the right ratio, N-Zorbit M powder can fully soak up the alcohol and still remain powdery.
For an example, Adams suggested drizzling 30 grams of high-proof (150- to 190-proof) alcohol into a mixing bowl containing 100 grams of N-Zorbit M while whisking steadily. You can then either sift it though a fine sieve or just use a blender to begin with.
Done properly, he says, you end up with strong soluble alcohol.
No need to limit yourself to rum or vodka. Any strong alcoholic liquor will do, including whiskey, tequila, gin and absinthe.
Ps. If you do make it yourself in any large quantities make sure to keep it in individual airtight freezer bags and depending on when you intend to use them store them in your fridge or deep-freezer.

Considering that our taste buds mature and change over time, many people may have a bad experience with beer prior to the age of 22 when most people begin to enjoy more savory flavors. Also, the first beer(s) that Americans, in particular, are likely to taste are truly disgusting - coors, budweiser, bud light, miller, etc. These beers are nicknamed &quot;piss water&quot; et al, for a reason - and, the idea that beer is gross might carry over into adulthood based on these experiences.
With that said, I would add here that there are also ways to approach turning a person into a &quot;real beer&quot; lover...

Start with a light beer with less of a flavor and body, such as ale, pilsner, or lager. Avoid whites, IPAs, and anything else that might have an &quot;extra&quot; flavor that could be taken as unappealing - unfortunately, this would go for stouts and porters too (my personal favorites.) Even &quot;beer people&quot; that I know and love don't always appreciate dark beers.

Ensure the beer is cold - icy cold. Beer is generally more palatable, for beginners especially, when it's chilled... we will discuss this more later.

Ensure the beer is bottled. (Please do not comment or respond to me about how there are studies that show there is no real taste difference between bottles and cans - I know all about those studies. I am not debating the finer points of drinking a canned beer from a glass.) The truth is that drinking a beer from a bottle always tastes better than drinking one from a can. Period.

Ensure that there are no other beverage options. Possibly the most important aspect in the conversion process... I will take you through a couple scenarios in which I have seen non-beer-drinkers become beer-drinkers:

Scenario a.) Serve beers when everyone is already inebriated. There are always going to be parties or gatherings at which the well runs dry, so to speak. If you can manage this by design, you might discover that your target audience is much more likely to drink beverages, that they normally would not, after they are already a bit tipsy. So, if your people are still thirsty when there is nothing else to drink, break out the beers.

Scenario b.) Serve cold beers on a hot day and/or after a strenuous activity. This is where step 2 above becomes very handy... when one is very hot, an icy cold beer is even more palatable - beer lover or not. Even an icy cold budweiser in a bottle becomes a welcome relief in such instances.

Sweetness is a way to express the amount of residual sugars to alcohol levels in a wine or champagne.

Rough rules of thumb say if a wine's alcohol content is 10% or less it will have sweet characteristics.  Wines that are even lower (especially down around 8 or 9 percent) will definitely be sweet. Wines in the 11% to 12.5% ABV range are considered 'off-dry' meaning that there is some notable residual sugar.  If it’s 12.5 percent or higher, the wine will will be 'dry' and have little to no perceptible sweetness.
Most wines under 10% ABV will be sweet. Typically, wines such as German Riesling and Italian Moscato fall in this category. Wines in the range of 10.5% to 12.5% include Riesling's from Austria, Australia and the U.S., Sauvignon Blanc, and Pinot Grigio (a.k.a. Pinot Gris).  Then, in the 12.5% to 15.5% range you find Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Sangiovese, Syrah, Grenache and Zinfandel.
But, as previously pointed out, a grape that starts with low sugar levels, and ferments to the point where all the sugar is consumed by the yeast, will result in a wine with lower alcohol levels and little to no residual sugar. So, this is why alcohol levels are not a dependable way of determining a wine's sweetness.
So, while there’s definitely a loose relationship between a wine’s residual sugar and its alcohol level, it’s not a simple relationship.  But you can use the percent alcohol printed on the label as a first indication. - Is There a Relationship Between a Wine's Sweetness and Its Alcohol Level?

9312,2,,2021-04-20T14:24:41.043,2,,"Alcohol content is not the primary driver of the cost of beer and so unfortunately there is not formula for directly mapping the price of a beer to its alcohol content. There are a number of ingredients in beer, and the non-alcohol producing ingredients (hops and other flavoring ingredients) can easily cost as much or more than the ingredients that produce the alcohol (malts, adjuncts, other fermentable sugars.)
This is why some extremely high alcohol beverages (malt beverages, cheap vodka) can cost far less per ounce than a high quality, considerably lower alcohol beer.
HOWEVER:  If you're not looking for a general formula, but want to compare two specific beers, the formula would be to multiply the ABV by the unit of measure for the beer (ounces here in the U.S.) and then divide the results by the price.
EXAMPLE: So I have two beers, one that is 12oz and 4.9% ABV, and costs $0.83 per can, and a second beer that is 16oz and 9.2% ABV, and costs $3.00 per can.
For beer one I multiple the alcohol times the quantity 0.049 * 12 = 0.588  (It contains 0.588oz of alcohol per can.) Now I divide the price ($0.83) by the alcohol content (0.588) and I find that the first beer costs $1.42 per ounce of alcohol.
For beer two I multiple the alcohol times the quantity 0.092 * 16 = 1.472  (It contains 1.472oz of alcohol per can.) Now I divide the price ($3.00) by the alcohol content (1.472) and I find that the second beer costs $2.04 per ounce of alcohol.
So, in this specific case, the lower alcohol beer delivers more alcohol for the price.  ($1.42/oz vs. $2.04/oz.)
GENERAL FORMULA: Units are as you give them (Use price in dollars and volume in ounces to get $/ounce -- Use price in Euros and volume in milliliters to get €/ml -- etc.)
Price of alcohol content = [Price of package of beer] / ([Units per package] * [Volume per unit] * [ABV])

Rhetorical Question: Does a (in your opinion) different tasting Laphroaig make a poorer product?
When we talk about mere quality, there were huge positive steps in the scotch whisky industry over the past 20 to 30 years.

The wash (beer that is destilled)

In the past, the washbacks, often made of wood, were cleaned by hand. This lead to a fluctuating cleaning result, and especially in warm weather periods (which even occur in scotland), it happend for the wash to be infected by vinegar bacteria, which made the resulting New Make taste sour. Today a lot of washbacks are made of steel and even the remaining wooden ones are washed by automated cleaning systems for a much better and more consistent result.

The pot stills

In the past the pot stills where directly heated with coals. When you have a high temperature concentrated on a small point, solid parts get burnt on pot still and lead to bitter notes in the New Make. Today a rotating rummager is widely used, which heats much more evenly and prevents this effect.

Cask management

In the past the cask management was lacking details, or history, of a certain cask. How often was it used? Which destillery did it came from? This lead to casks being used to often and it made it difficult for the blend master to get a consistent batch for a certain bottling, since he has a recipie, but the casks where not labelled sufficient enough. Today a cask gets a barcode which contains all the information what a cask went through which makes trading easier and get more precise results over time.
One problem the scotch whisky industry is facing, is the huge growth in demand for Single Malt whisky. The the past, about 10% to 20% of the whisky production of a distillery went into Single Malts, the rest into the blending idustry. Today it is about 50% to 100%. This changes the cask selection for blends, since some destilleries don't provide them with casks anymore, and also for Single Malts. Because of the high demand, a lot of popular distilleries went out of longer matured casks and had to change their portfolio to younger bottlings, or create No Age Statement bottlings.
This had, of course, a huge impact on consistency in terms of taste.
So, to answer your question(s):
&quot;Which single malt Scotches have improved over the last 20 years?&quot;: pretty much all
&quot;Are there any single malts where there is a consensus that they have remained reasonably consistent&quot;: probably none

Generally speaking, cocktails are measured by volume not weight.

Jiggers, cups, and other tools you use to measure out ingredients for a cocktail.
Your options here are simple and few, so this is not terribly complicated.
Jiggers
Jiggers are the basic hourglass-shaped stainless-steel measuring device you've seen in many a bar. These are cheap and easy to find in most housewares stores, or online. Typically, the larger cup measures out exactly one jigger, or 1 1/2 ounces. The smaller cup is normally one half jigger, or 3/4 ounces. Be careful, a number of other sizes exist, and you should know what units you're working in.
Many professional bartenders have built up strong proficiency with using these in settings where speed is of an essence. The way to use a jigger most efficiently is to hold it between thumb and forefinger, or between your first thumb and forefinger, or between your first and second fingers, like so:
Hold the jigger steady, and fill it brim-full with your liquid of choice; and then it's easy to quickly tip the contents into a shaker or mixing glass.
Another type of jigger is similar to the hourglass model, but it's mounted on a rod.
Measuring Cups
Really, though, it's rare that a home bartender needs to worry about speed. A professional bartender in a high-capacity bar needs to work lightning fast, obviously, but for the home schlub mixing a pre-dinner daiquiri, it's just not necessary.
At home, I almost never use a jigger, unless I just want to practice my jiggering. First of all, not all jiggers are equal: some that might appear to measure a true jigger actually measure 1 1/4 ounces instead of 1 1/2. (The model with the handle, in the picture at top, is one such miscreant.) If I want accuracy in my measuring (and I do), I don't want to have to second-guess the capacity of my tools. My measurer of choice is the Oxo mini angled measuring cup.
I love this darned thing and I use it daily. I even preferred it during my stint as a pro bartender. I only have one problem with it: there's no mark for 3/4 ounces. I usually eyeball it, or if I need more precision, I measure 1/2 and then 1/4 ounces.
I should note, too, that some bartenders don't like measuring amounts as small as 1/4 ounce in these cups. To explain why, I need to mention something called a meniscus. It's the curve in the upper surface of a liquid that's in a container. The reason some people see this as a problem is that the curve can make it difficult to accurately read how close you are to the 1/4-oz. mark.
I have to say I'm not convinced it's always a problem. At most we're looking at a couple of drops of liquid's difference between an accurate measure and an inaccurate measure. If you're measuring a strongly flavored ingredient, such as absinthe or Fernet Branca, a couple of extra drops could affect a cocktail. But for milder tasting ingredients such as lemon juice or simple syrup, it's not going to make a huge difference. - Cocktail 101: Measuring Utensils

Jiggers are used for accurate measurements and are the foundation of consistent cocktails.
A cocktail jigger is a shot or cocktail measuring cup for bartenders, ranging in sizes of 0.5-2.5 oz. For ease of use, many jiggers have fill lines on the inside or outside with oft-used cocktail or shot glass measurements.
The word jigger can also be used as a unit of measurement in cocktail recipes. If you happen to come across a recipe that calls for a jigger (or jigger shot) of any spirit, that refers to the standard jigger size of 1.5 oz. Shot glasses come in various sizes, but a standard shot glass is also 1.5 oz. So in some instances, a jigger and a shot can refer to the same thing. A smaller 1 oz shot, or the 1 oz side of the jigger, is referred to as a “pony shot.”

Common Jigger Sizes
Generally, these bar measures come in a variety of sizes, including:

2oz.

1.5 oz.

1 oz.

.75 oz.

Green label was added to the fold in 1997. Originally called Pure Malt, it was renamed Green Label in 2004. There is very little smoke at all in Green label. It is made with malt whisky only and has a sweeter more honied flavour profile and is exceptionally smooth.

You'd be hard put to it to find anything distinctively Asian about these, but there are some Asian variants developed from them.
In Japan they have happoshu, a kind of cheap beer that uses less malt and more sugar from other sources, simply for tax reasons. Vietnam also has a local variant of quickly-brewed lager beers sold cheaply in the street, called bia hoi.
However, traditional Asian beer as brewed by the farmers for their own use is a completely different story. These exist in places like Bhutan, Nepal, and probably quite a few more places, and are brewed according to local traditions that are totally different from western beer.
Western beer is made from malt, but these beers are usually brewed from raw grain using a fungus that breaks down the starch and makes sugar. Japanese sake (rice &quot;beer&quot;) and Chinese huangjiu (rice &quot;beer&quot; and grain beer) are also made this way and could be considered Asian types of beer.

Green wine (Vinho Verde) is basically an inexpensive young wine.

Vinho Verde (literally 'green wine') refers to Portuguese wine that originated in the historic Minho province in the far north of the country. The modern-day 'Vinho Verde' region, originally designated in 1908, includes the old Minho province plus adjacent areas to the south. In 1976, the old province was dissolved.
Vinho Verde is not a grape variety, it is a DOC for the production of wine. The name means &quot;green wine,&quot; but translates as &quot;young wine&quot;, with wine being released three to six months after the grapes are harvested. They may be red, white, or rosé, and they are usually consumed soon after bottling. A Vinho Verde can also be a sparkling, a Late Harvest or even Brandy. In its early years of production, the slight effervesce of the wine came from malolactic fermentation taking place in the bottle. In winemaking this is usually considered a wine fault but Vinho Verde producers found that consumers liked the slightly fizzy nature. However, the wines had to be packaged in opaque bottles to hide the unseemly turbidity and sediment that the &quot;in-bottle MLF&quot; produced. Today, most Vinho Verde producers no longer follow this practice with the slight sparkle being added by artificial carbonation.

Vinho Verde Is meant to be drunk young, traditionally at least. Don’t put this in your cellar expecting it to improve, just drink it. Knowing that it’s meant to be drunk straight away, some manufacturers don’t even bother putting the vintage date on the bottle.
It is not actually green in colour. Green does not mean that the wine is actually green. If you were worried that you were going to have to drink something the colour of pond water, that probably comes as a relief. Or, maybe it comes as a disappointment. It wasn’t that long ago that orange wine was all the rage, so it wouldn’t be surprising if people were keen to try something that looked like it had been made by Gatorade.
As such I would like to know what pairs well with this type of wine?

9358,2,,2021-07-23T18:21:48.240,3,,"How Can You Avoid Skunky Beer?
The best way to avoid skunking of beer is as follows:

Block out as much UV light as possible in all stages within the beer brewing process and storage.
Use brown bottle in lieu of clear or green bottles.
Use of opaque keys are best!
Keep bottled beer out of direct sunlight.
Storing in a cool or cold environment, like in a refrigerator.

A skunked beer tastes like a skunk smells (not good). But what makes beer skunky? It’s commonly thought that subjecting beer to variations in temperature will skunk it. However, skunkiness in beer is caused not by heat, but by light.

What Causes Skunky Beers
Contrary to popular belief, beer does not become skunked after exposure to heating and cooling – unless you’re regularly boiling and nearly freezing your beer. (It does, however, increase the speed at which your beer oxidizes, leading to a slightly less offending wet cardboard flavor.) Instead, the main culprit behind skunking is the UV rays of the sun.
Over time and in large enough quantities, the blue spectrum of UV light interacts with the hop compounds (isohumulones) in your beer, breaking them down and lending an electron to an amino acid. The result is the dreaded MBT compound that gives your beer that skunked flavor.
How Can You Avoid Skunky Beer?
The first step in skunky beer prevention occurs at the brewery – brewers choose packaging that helps to block out UV light and avoid skunking altogether. Kegs and cans are completely opaque and are the best way to prevent skunking, and brown bottles come in a close second – there’s a reason most craft beers are packaged in these two containers. Green and clear bottles let in the most UV light, and the beer contained within is thus the most susceptible to producing MBT.
Skunking can happen at any time– usually during the warehousing or in-store portions of your beer’s trip to your fridge. That means there isn’t a lot you need to do to prevent skunking except purchase beers that come in cans or brown bottles. If your favorites are packaged in clear or green bottles, just do your best to keep your beer out of the sun.

The best way is to keep the beer cans out of direct sunlight and store them in a cool environment as best as possible.
Normally cans of beer should not explode and your situation as mentioned in the comments is an isolated event. Your can may have been defective in some way or became damaged during transport.
I have had cans explode on me by accidentally dropping them in a hard surface floor, so I would try to avoid that too.
Some believe that overcarbonation is also another issue apparently, especially with a few craft beers in cans.

Beer is the age-old summer favorite drink for barbecues, bars, and trips to the beach. But recent summers have seen a fair share of critical injuries caused by exploding beer bottles and cans. A New York City bartender at The Frying Pan restaurant recently filed a negligence lawsuit against brewing giant Constellation Brands Inc., and others after he was left permanently blinded when an unopened Corona bottle exploded. This incident comes on the heels of several other beer product-related injuries, including recent reports of craft beer cans exploding. Although these may seem like straightforward product liability cases, the complexity of the beer fermentation process and the storage precautions consumers are expected to take beg the question of who is liable for these safety hazards.
According to Draft Magazine, beer bottles tend to explode as a result of [**overcarbonation. If a beer is bottled before the fermentation process is complete, the resulting carbon dioxide has the potential to build up enough pressure to break glass and cause serious injuries. - Exploding Beer Bottles And Cans: A New Wave Of Product Liability Litigation

Generally speaking though such cases are extremely rare. And again, in normal air conditioned home cans should not explode. If you do not have air conditioning, use your refrigerator, at least for the craft beers, just to be on the safe side.

Recently I chose to have my whiskey served over ice.  The bartender pulled out a large cube from the freezer and let it sit in the glass for a minute or two before pouring the drink over it.  His stated reason was that &quot;it would melt less&quot; in my glass.
As I make my own whiskey balls at home, I've been searching for any scientific basis for this claim to try to confirm this claim, but haven't found anything.  I did find a link suggesting this practice was to prevent cracking:

it’s very important to temper the ice before use. That means let the ice sit out on the counter for about 5 minutes or until the freezer frost disappears. Ice is too hard and too cold when it first comes out of the freezer. If you pour your favorite spirit on the silicone mold prepared ice ball ... it will crack. By introducing something room temperature to the ice, you condition the outer part of the ice before you make it into an ice ball or put in your drink. You get a perfect ice ball every time.

While I have observed my ice cracking as described, it doesn't bother me, and seems purely aesthetic.  I can thus understand how in a service environment such as a bar, presentation is important.
Does cracking ice impact the drink in any other way?  From the description above, it seems the &quot;freezer frost&quot; disappears somewhere; would this frost end up as water in my glass, as the bartender claimed, in addition to the cracking?  Does it have an impact on how quickly the drink is chilled?

Each crack increases the surface area of the ice. If you think back to your Chemistry class in school, you can increase phase change and chemical reactions through three main physical ways: increasing surface area, application of heat, and by shaking/stirring.
The warmer liquor will (eventually) work into the cracks, and increase ice melt due to increased contact with the larger surface area.
Is that increased ice melt due to cracks going to be significant enough that you notice when drinking your whiskey? I can't say. Even if I could point to a scientific study that quantified the difference, it's ultimately down to your personal taste.

The film site is roughly 38 miles (60 km) south of Oregon and 18 miles (30 km) east of the Pacific Ocean.

In the toasting process of a barrel, the sugar in the wood caramelizes (cellulose is a sugar polymer and breaks into sugar during the charring process). The liquid has contact with this &quot;caramel&quot;, and due to additive maturation, some of it goes into the liquid.
The amount of sugar heavily depends on the toasting grade, time of aging and time a barrel was already used, but in general, it is very low. Sugar concentration analyses of whisky showed an amount ranging from 150 mg/l to 400 mg/l which is too low for human perception.
If the barrel had some previous contents (sherry for example), the sugar concentration can be much higher.

Generally speaking I do not believe so. Nevertheless, one should know the vodkas you are buying!

To begin with, why is it that for most people the difference between a good and bad vodka is practically indistinguishable? Well, part of that has to do with regulation. See, in many parts of the world, there is specific regulations designed to ensure that vodka is “without distinctive character, aroma, taste or colour.” That seems to lay the ground work for an industry that should be pretty much uniform across the board right? Well, not quite.
First there is going to be a difference based on what the vodka is being distilled from. Vodka is traditionally made by distilling cereal grains or potatoes that have been fermented. Generally rye and wheat varieties are usually considered higher quality, and therefore you’ll find these bottles to be higher in price point. However, some vodkas can be made from ingredients like molasses, soybeans or rice, and on the rare occasion they’re made from byproducts of oil refining or wood pulp processing. That doesn’t sound appealing does it?
What tends to happen with the “cheaper” varieties is that many of the impurities of the refining process linger, leaving an unpleasant taste or worse yet an unpleasant hangover. Don’t be fooled by the amount of times a vodka is distilled either; it doesn’t matter if a vodka made with poor ingredients is distilled three or more times, you’ve still started with a poor product.
Now, don’t take this to mean that “bad” means “cheap”, or even “good” means “expensive”; the reality is there are a number of great vodkas, made with quality ingredients that fall across all price points. Bad vodka is just poorly made, but good vodka doesn’t have to be expensive. What tends to affect the price point more than anything is the marketing around a vodka, so that “ultra premium” vodka you’re purchasing is more of a lifestyle choice than anything.
All that being said, there are a few excellent vodkas you can rely on when heading into the liquor store. Each serve their own purpose, whether it’s a decent inexpensive bottle for cocktails, or something to act as a showpiece. - Is There Really a Difference Between “Good” and “Bad” Vodka?

Most vodkas on the international market do not fit into the above definition of less good or even bad compared to domestically sold vodkas. I can find no evidence to support a response in the affirmative to this question.
Thus vodkas made for exportation are generally quite good vodkas. In any case, know the vodkas you are buying and read up on them.

Aperol is clearly the sweeter of the two and maybe somewhat less bitter at the same time.

Campari vs Aperol: what’s the difference?
Campari and Aperol are Italian bitter liquors with several key differences. Here’s a breakdown:
Campari overview
Origin: Campari was invented in Italy in 1860 by Gaspare Campari in Novare, Italy. Because it’s got such a long history, it’s a featured ingredient in classic cocktails like the Negroni.
Colour: Campari is bright red in color. Fun fact: The bright red color of Campari originally came from a dye made of crushed insects! That’s no longer in the modern recipe, so it shouldn’t deter you from grabbing a bottle.
Flavour: Campari tastes very bitter, with sweet notes like cherry, clove, cinnamon and orange peel.
Alcohol content: Campari is 48 proof or 24 percent ABV, almost twice that of Aperol.
Aperol overview
Origin: Aperol was also invented in Italy, but much later in 1919. Brothers Luigi and Silvio Barbieri created this aperitif in Padua, Italy. The company that sells Campari, Gruppo Campari, bought Aperol in the 1990s.
Colour: Aperol is a bright orange color: it’s very distinct from Campari.
Flavour: The flavor of Aperol is sweeter and more balanced than Campari, with notes of citrus and herbs.
Alcohol content: Aperol has a lower alcohol content than Campari: it is 22 proof or 11 percent ABV.

There will be extra calories in some drinks due to the carbs in them, but the difference is relatively minor compared to the ethanol:

The short answer is possibly, if they employ certain food colourings.
It is not even possible that some French Cognacs may contain residual sugars.

Residual sugars
Residual sugars, as defined in the FDR, are sugars that are still present in beer after the fermentation process has been completed.

Seeing that cognac is a distilled liquor of 40% makes it very unlikely that the French would add sugar to their finished product. This would additionally alter the taste of the Real McCoy

All Cognac is brandy, but not all brandy can be considered Cognac.
For a brandy to be called Cognac, it must be made from specified grape varieties grown in the AOC (a majority of Ugni Blanc, with small portions of Colombard and Folle Blanche allowed), double-distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in Limousin or Tronçais oak barrels. Cognac must be at least 40 percent alcohol.
The designations you see on Cognac labels—VS (Very Special), VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale) and XO (Extra Old)—are a guarantee of how long a Cognac has been aged. VS indicates that the Cognac has been aged at least two years, VSOP at least four years and XO (Extra Old) at least six years. Most Cognacs are aged much longer, however, featuring a blend of eaux de vie that can date back decades.
Coloring can legally be added to Cognacs to ensure consistency.

In 1950, the top brewer, Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., produced 3.4 million more barrels than the 10th brewer, now-defunct Pfeiffer Brewing Co. By 2017, the distance between top-producing Anheuser-Busch and the 10th-biggest brewer, Mike’s Hard Lemonade Co., was more than 87.5 million barrels.

Charted: America’s Biggest Brewers by Decade, From 1950 to Now

Lucky Lager was quite popular both in the USA and Canada.

Lucky Lager is an American lager with U.S. brewing and distribution rights held by the Pabst Brewing Company. Originally launched in 1934 by the San Francisco-based General Brewing Company, Lucky Lager grew to be one of the prominent beers of the Western United States during the 1950s and 1960s. In 2019, Pabst announced that the beer brand would be revived and would be brewed by 21st Amendment Brewery, a brewery based in San Leandro.

As far as whisky goes, I.W.Harper was the most popular.

In the late 1950s and 60s, you would be hard-pressed to find a whiskey drinker who hadn’t heard of I.W. Harper bourbon. The brand was one of the products of the Bernheim Brothers distillery; a Kentucky-based operation founded in the mid-1800s, and enjoyed a surge in popularity after World War II. Advertisements boasted that it was &quot;the only bourbon enjoyed in 110 countries,&quot; and a favorite of travelers on ocean liners. In the 1969 Bond movie One Her Majesty’s Secret Service, 007 eschews his usual martini for I.W. Harper on ice.- The Return of a Classic American Whiskey

The whiskeys Laphroaig and Bowmore seems to be also quite popular also.

When it comes to the 1960s, there are perhaps two names which stand tall above all others in my book. Laphroaig and Bowmore. These two Islay malts encompass everything that was wonderful about whisky making in this era. Each had fully operational floor maltings using their own source of peat. Each began the decade with direct coal firing and worm tubs; each entered the 1970s converted to steam and condensers. For much of the 1960s each shared the same Glasgow brewery yeast source. Each make would go on to be characterised by intense and almost mesmeric interplay between tropical fruits and peat smoke. Each was sublime from 8 to 40 years of age. Each distillery’s 1960s output fed some stunning younger official bottlings in the 1970s and 1980s. Each distillate is regarded today as some of the finest whisky ever produced. - The most important decade in Whisky: The Legendary 1960s

Back in the day, wine was not cheap and usually drank on specific occasions.
Some mixed drinks became popular in the 1950s:

The Popular Mixed Drinks of the 50s &amp; 60s
By the 1950s, the cocktail had thoroughly permeated American society. Post - WW II soldiers had returned with tales of tropical rum drinks, and gin martinis became all the rage. Although the Manhattan and the Cuba Libre were common drinks for both men and women, sweet dessert-like cocktails, such as the sloe gin fizz and the festively green grasshopper, were ladylike beverages suitable for the novice drinker.
Although today's martinis are made with anything from chocolate liquor to vodka and pomegranate juice, the original cocktail was made only with gin and dry vermouth with a green olive on a fancy toothpick for garnish. The less vermouth, the drier the martini; some said one should only wave the vermouth bottle over the shaker. Switch out the olive for pickled pearl onions and you have a Gibson. Vermouth -- sweet, not dry -- is also a key ingredient in another classic that turns up in old movies: the rye whiskey-based Manhattan. Gin with lemon juice and sugar creates the Tom Collins, a popular summer cooler.
The 1956 Andrews Sisters hit song &quot;Rum and Coca Cola&quot; was a nod to the post-war popularity of rum, which inspired the Cuba Libre, a simple combination of cola and lime. When Polynesian tiki restaurants took off, tropical drinks with umbrellas began a long run of popularity. The Trader Vic's mai tai, made with light rum, orange liqueur, almond syrup, fresh lime juice and rock candy syrup, turned up at cocktail parties alongside the teeny weenies and the bacon-wrapped water chestnuts known as rumaki. Pineapple and coconut flavors made the frothy pina colada a popular poolside rum refreshment. The zombie, a combination of three rums with apricot brandy and a variety of juices, was so powerful that bars often limited customers to two servings.
As co-ed drinking came into vogue, many of the cocktails were designed to attract women. The sumptuous creme de menthe and creme de cacao grasshopper was sometimes blended with ice cream, like a green alcoholic milkshake, and the sweet and fruity sloe gin fizz might as well have come from a soda fountain tap. The simplest of all was the white Russian, a simple mixture of vodka, Kahlua and cream. These drinks were often served either with or in place of dessert.
As the weekend brunch became popular as social gatherings in homes and restaurants, drinks began to take on a healthy disguise. A stick of celery and a couple of olives added to tomato juice and vodka made the bloody Mary cocktail practically a food group of its own. The screwdriver -- simply orange juice and vodka -- provided a good dose of vitamin C, as did its grapefruit juice cousin, the greyhound. Once only known in New Orleans, the elaborate and airy Ramos gin fizz made a comeback for brunch events.

I would like to say no.
Having drank many cloudy beers and wines back in the day, they make no difference to me.
Generally speaking, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to have a hangover the next day.

A hangover is a group of unpleasant signs and symptoms that can develop after drinking too much alcohol. As if feeling awful weren't bad enough, frequent hangovers are also associated with poor performance and conflict at work.
As a general rule, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to have a hangover the next day. But there's no magic formula to tell you how much you can safely drink and still avoid a hangover.
However unpleasant, most hangovers go away on their own, though they can last up to 24 hours. If you choose to drink alcohol, doing so responsibly can help you avoid future hangovers. - Hangovers

9429,2,,2021-12-17T07:06:56.197,3,,"MWB's answer addressed the first question, indicating that alcohol calories behave similar to fat.
Regarding your second question comparing moderate daily intake to binge drinking, the answer seems to be complex.  This study indicates correlation, but not causation:

In general, recent prospective studies show that light-to-moderate alcohol intake is not associated with adiposity gain while heavy drinking is more consistently related to weight gain.
...
However, many factors can explain the conflicting findings and a better characterization of individuals more likely to gain weight as a result of alcohol consumption is needed. In particular, individuals who frequently drink moderate amounts of alcohol may enjoy a healthier lifestyle in general that may protect them from weight gain.

Another study referenced by the one quoted above gives a bit more insight, noting that while the calories may be the same, the interaction with and/or separation from food may be an important factor, but is still secondary to other factors:

Current research clearly shows that energy consumed as alcohol is additive to that from other dietary sources, leading to short-term passive over-consumption of energy when alcohol is consumed. Indeed, alcohol consumed before or with meals tends to increase food intake, probably through enhancing the short-term rewarding effects of food. However, while these data might suggest that alcohol is a risk factor for obesity, epidemiological data suggests that moderate alcohol intake may protect against obesity, particularly in women. In contrast, higher intakes of alcohol in the absence of alcohol dependence may increase the risk of obesity, as may binge-drinking, however these effects may be secondary to personality and habitual beverage preferences.

So in sum... the chemical energy is the same. But timing of the caloric intake does have some relevance and multiple impacts.

9430,2,,2021-12-17T23:30:19.780,2,,"I found this paper (PDF) called &quot;Alcohol Consumption and Obesity: An Update&quot;.
It reviews a number of experiments where scientists gave people alcohol and observed changes in their weight after a few weeks. Their summary:

Overall, the available experimental evidence reviewed in this article
suggests that moderate intake of alcohol does not lead to weight gain.
The systematic review by Bendsen et al. [3•]suggests that this trend
is less likely in experimental studies examining beer consumption
exclusively. Also, the intervention periods in the aforementioned
studies ranged from 4–10 weeks,and therefore may not have been long
enough to identify the slight changes in weight that can accumulate
over time to result in overweight or obesity. A modest increase in
weight of one kilogram over a 10 week period seems insignificant but
over five years this could result in up to 26 kg of weight gain if
no compensation takes place. To our knowledge, there does not appear to
be any experimental evidence specifically testing the effects of
heavy/binge drinking, or of drinking spirits or a combination of
alcohol sources on weight gain/obesity.

However, this is generally mixing three effects:

alcohol's effect on food consumption (changes in hunger)
the energy being absorbed from alcohol itself
the effect of alcohol on how the energy is absorbed from other food (some say that since the body prioritizes digesting alcohol, it's not digesting other food as efficiently)

If we look at the description of one of the studies (above this summary):

Fletchner-Mors et al. [53]found that replacing 10% of total daily
energy intake during a weight-loss intervention with either grape
juice or white wine resulted in similar weight loss, with the white
wine group showing a slightly higher (although not statistically
significant) weight loss. In this case both diets were isoenergetic so
this is not a surprising result, as the thermic effect of food was
likely higher for white wine than grape juice[53,54].

(emphasis added)
It basically says that (when all calories were counted), the effect of wine on weight gain/loss was essentially the same as that of grape juice with the same amount of calories.

Does anyone know of any drinking traditions of a popular drink that is mentioned in popular historical literature.
I am not limiting to English language, but if one does please provide a translation.
What got me thinking of this was reading about a Smoking Bishop that is mentioned in Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol.

Originating in Britain and immortalized by Charles Dickens (1812-1870), a Smoking Bishop is a ‘smoking’ hot drink of wine and port mulled together with the juice of roasted bitter oranges, cloves, star anise, sugar and (occasionally) cinnamon. Compared to traditional mulled wine, which can sometimes be overwhelming, the spices take a minor role in a Smoking Bishop. With port, oranges and sugar, one would expect an overly sweet drink. But the after-punch of bitter fruit is the real star here, pulling our taste buds along a pleasant tightrope of flavor. Finding the balance is key to a good Smoking Bishop… and people have been trying since the 1800’s.
On December 17, 1843, the Smoking Bishop became etched in history with the publication of A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens. Dickens places the drink in the final scene of the book, when Ebenezer Scrooge offers his overworked employee, Bob Cratchit (the dad of Tiny Tim), a bowl of Smoking Bishop, along with his promise to be, well… less of a Scrooge. Considering the book sold 5,000 copies by Christmas Eve (6 days later) and has never been out of print, I’d say readers felt this merry conclusion was a success.

“A Merry Christmas, Bob!” said Scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavor to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a bowl of Smoking Bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i Bob Cratchit!


Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more…” – A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens.

What is a Smoking Bishop?

Max Miller in his series Tasting History with Max Miller has aa interesting YouTube video on this subject: Smoking Bishop from A Christmas Carol.
In this video, Max gives an impressive account of a Smoking Bishop as a mulled wine as well as a fine recipe and pointers on making it.
However, back to the question at hand. Does anyone known of any classical or traditional drinks in historical literature that is not well known in our days?
A recipe would be greatly appreciated. Historically, I am limiting this to 1900 AD or earlier.

9439,1,,2022-01-04T05:56:14.990,0,117,"Humans have been drinking alcohol for its intoxicating effects. For intoxication a small amount of alcohol is sufficient, but because the liver is very efficient in filtering it, we need more of it to get intoxicated.
This seems to be the main problem. This is what causes us to drink a lot to get high. This is also what causes liver damage over a long period of time and in short term this is what causes hangover.
This metabolic pathway changes if we co-administer lesser amount of alcohol with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) inhibitor like 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) which slows down breaking of alcohol and one could achieve same amounts of intoxication with comparatively very less alcohol.
Apparently Wikipedia agrees with this, but warns that if the alcohol dose is not reduced then it may cause severe intoxication and overdose.

Concurrent use with ethanol is contraindicated because fomepizole is
known to prolong the half-life of ethanol via inhibiting its
metabolism. Extending the half-life of ethanol may increase and extend
the intoxicating effects of ethanol, allowing for greater (potentially
dangerous) levels of intoxication at lower doses. Fomepizole slows the
production of acetaldehyde by inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase, which
in turn allows more time to further convert acetaldehyde into acetic
acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The result is a patient with a
prolonged and deeper level of intoxication for any given dose of
ethanol, and reduced &quot;hangover&quot; symptoms (since these adverse symptoms
are largely mediated by acetaldehyde build up

But also agrees that if the dose is adjusted and lowered it can have a positive effect.

If alcoholics instead very carefully reduce their doses to reflect the
now slower metabolism, they may get the &quot;rewarding&quot; stimulus of
intoxication at lower doses with less adverse &quot;hangover&quot; effects -
leading potentially to increased psychological dependency. However,
these lower doses may therefore produce less chronic toxicity and
provide a harm minimization approach to chronic alcoholism

Now assuming that alcoholics are placed under strict supervision and two groups are given with just alcohol and alcohol with 4-MP, to achieve comparable intoxication.
So if group A receives, say 15ml of pure alcohol containing beverage, then B receives 3ml or so, of alcohol along with 4-MP.

Can this help in the prevention of alcohol related liver complications?
Is 4-MP, despite its short-term safety, is safe for long term use?

Is there any data is medical literature on this?

Edit: Regarding the concerns about toxicity.

According to Dr. Dasgupta's research, the perfect BAC in accordance
with these moderate drinking guidelines is 0.04 - 0.05%. When your BAC
is in this range, you feel good, you gain all the health benefits from
the alcohol, and you should not appear overly impaired

So even if we assume none of the alcohol breaks down, average human has around 5000 ml of blood. Reverse calculating it 2.5g of alcohol will cause a BAC of 0.05% which is ideal and non-toxic. So if we give someone 3ml of ethanol with 4-MP, then it is, at least theoretically, it's completely safe.

I am unsure of what brand it is because he would take home different kinds, one of his favorite one is Little Bay?, Budweiser Beer white kind, Aberlour whiskey which is like 7000 rupees in local market in India. So i am assuming it is definitely a good quality whiskey. Maybe the officers can have a better choice? i am unsure.

That will depend on several factors. The main factor will be what the alcohol content is in the wine. My personal guess that such wine would be of a lower alcohol content.
The alcohol content is probably the most important factor here. Sufficient alcohol naturally preserves very well.
Also make sure that the are not impurities in the final product.
Do not fear to add sulfites to your wine in order to help preserve your wine for a much greater duration of time.
Sulfites are used as a preservative in many food items, not just wine.

Sulfites such as Campden tablets and sodium metabisulfite make sure your wine does not spoil during the wine making process. After the wine has been made, sulfites help to insure that your wine will keep for many years and not just weeks or months in the wine bottle. Sulfites also help your wine to be free from the effects of oxidation. This is when the color of the wine darkens and the flavor taken on a little bitterness. Adding sulfites to homemade wine is not an absolute necessity, but it only makes sense to do so.
Potassium sorbate on the other hand is a different beast. It should only be used before bottling the wine – if at all. It is required if you are planning on back-sweetening your wine at bottling time. If it is not added along with the sweetening sugar, you stand a very strong chance of experiencing a re-fermentation of your wine while in the bottle. This can eventually result in popping corks and fizzy wine.
There is no reason to add potassium sorbate at any other time than at bottling. In fact, if it is added before the fermentation has completed it will most likely result in a sluggish or stuck fermentation. I would not recommend adding it at bottling time if you are not making a sweet wine. It is not necessary.
If you are making wine from fresh fruit, I always recommend adding sulfite to homemade wine about 24 hours before adding the yeast. Leave the wine must uncovered during this 24 hours so that the sulfite gas may dissipate. Then add the wine yeast as you normally would. Doing this will easily destroy any wild molds, bacteria, etc. that may be coming along with the fruit.
I always recommend that sulfite be added before bottling, as well. This is the dose that keeps the wine fresh and free of oxidation while in the wine bottle. Before fermentation and before bottling are the two times I would never forgo.
I also suggest adding sulfites to wine after the fermentation has completed. This is with the understanding that the wine is going to sit for a while before clearing up. This will keep any airborne contaminants from growing on your wine while clearing.
Adding sulfites to homemade wine is important and highly recommended. It’s like buying insurance for making a wine that doesn’t spoil or oxidize. If you do not add sulfites you can make wine successfully, but most will find it hard for the wine to keep over extended periods of time without refrigeration. - Adding Sulfites To Homemade Wine

Yorsh is a medium-strength alcoholic cocktail. Most often, the word
&quot;Yorsh (ruff)&quot; means a mixture of vodka and beer. A characteristic
feature of the mixture is that it causes intoxication faster than the
amount of beer or vodka corresponding to the volume of alcohol
separately. A similar effect is achieved due to the effect of carbon
dioxide contained in beer on the gastric mucosa, which contributes to
the rapid absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream.
See the history of the cocktail above
&quot;Polar Bear(White Bear)&quot; (also &quot;Northern Lights&quot;) - a mixture of vodka or alcohol
with champagne. The name originated in the north, when the tedder (a
stolen awl - that is, stolen alcohol) began to interfere with
champagne. During the perestroika period, the Brown Bear cocktail
appeared.


mixture of vodka or alcohol - By alcohol it should be understood - a drink of 90° strength (from lat. spiritus)

History reference Polar/White Bear
The exact time of discovery and the author of the recipe are unknown. According to legend, Siberian gold miners came up with the cocktail, approximately in the 70s of the XX century, when vodka, cognac and champagne began to be imported into their working settlements.
In fact, this is one cocktail - in solid alcohol with sparkling wine. Champagne with vodka is called “Polar/White Bear”, and champagne with cognac is called “Brown Bear”, because it has a brown color. To taste, both options are suitable, but &quot;Brown Bear&quot; from the tannic tones of barrel-aged cognac.
Another similar cocktail is Northern Lights, but it is more gentle, as it contains lemon juice and sugar, which soften the taste.

9496,2,,2022-07-22T11:16:29.213,2,,"The Standard Pour Origins
To answer specifically where the idea of pouring 30ml, 60ml, and 90ml began or where it came from is not scientific, but mathematical as a result of business cost &amp; inventory management and, more or less stemmed from the standardizations of fill amounts for wine and liquor, at least when referring to the 30ml amount.
While the 60ml and 90ml amounts are merely multiples of the standard 30ml pout, they also have a different story about them as later explained. But, to answer the question of where or how a standard pour began, you have to start at the point where there was any sort of standardization of alcohol in the first place, which mostly involved only those who produced it on a mass scale.
(It's worth noting that the question asked about 3 specific pour volume amounts and how they allegedly are a standard, but then mentions a measurement specific to India and Nepal as quoted, referred to as the peg &amp; Palatia peg, without any context to their relationship to the 3 mentioned volumes. Therefore it is assumed that the OP infers the peg has a role in those 3 mentioned measurements and the answer below is provided within that assumed context.)
From Standard Bottles to Standard Pours
While historically speaking, on a world trade level, the standardization of the fill amount for wine and liquor was set in Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations of 1979, which most countries adopted as part of their desire to participate in world trades as can be seen by the updates being made even as recent as 2020 and witnessed here by the US and here by European nations, suggesting that regulations on trade are what officially set the standard for bottling.

In order to ensure the implementation of the Agreement between the
European Union and Japan for an Economic Partnership (12), it was
necessary to provide for a derogation from the nominal quantities set
out in the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council (13) for spirit drinks in order to allow single
distilled shochu produced by pot still and bottled in Japan to be
placed on the Union market in traditional Japanese bottle sizes.

While this might seem to only prove that adjustments will be made in the interest of &quot;Economic Partnerships&quot;, it also exemplifies a governing body's desire to regulate the sale and trade of alcohol which lead to the standard bottling and fill size. While in most countries, the most well know standard of bottling size is the 750ml for bottles of wine which has numerous theories of how it came to be depending on who you ask, the point here is that when standard bottling sizes were set and regulated for trade, most countries adopted them for economic trade reasons. And, even India has multiple theories for how the measurement of the peg got it's name according to the Patiala Peg link which has likely since been updated as it now explains:

The Patiala peg is a peg of whisky in which the amount is decided
based on the height between the top of the index and base of the
little fingers when held parallel to one another, against the side of
the standard 26.5 oz (750ml) glass bottle.

The important thing to note is the use of the standard 750ml because it all ties back to that standard 750ml glass bottle:

When considering a 750ml bottles of liquor, one theory points out that pouring 30ml per glass allows for exactly 25 glasses or &quot;shots&quot; (1 fl. oz. glasses) to be poured and served, an even distribution. So, from global trade, to local businesses like that of a saloon owner, restaurant owner, or drink service business owner, it makes inventory easier to keep track of when you can evenly divide your products for guest sale and consumption.
When considering a 750ml bottle of wine, one theory suggests that it's because it allows for the standard serving size of 6 glasses of win at 125ml each, used in osterie (wine tavern).

The Need to Measure Any Sort of Pour Amount
Arguably, the only time you would measure out how much you pour is if you were running a business and tracking inventory or if you were trying to ration your alcohol consumption in some way. Otherwise, in summary, the idea comes from a matter of trade and business. AS far as the 750ml standardization, there's plenty of theories out there to argue history, but more or less, it was the most agreeable amount among bottle makers, wine makes, and meal time drinkers.
The question of whether or not the peg originated in India, can be answered by the Wikipedia page, noting the source explaining that liquor companies started making those sizes 60ml and 90ml sized bottles...

...in a bid to encourage more people to try their drinks and attract
younger consumers.

Conclusion
In summary, the 30 ml pour originated as a division of the standard fill amount for 750ml bottles, which again, has many different explanations, theories or reasons why it was chosen, while it would seem the pours of 60ml and 90ml are simply a common multiple of 30ml to evenly divide a bottle of alcohol being poured and sold for service as in those amounts, as it allows for a step up in order amount for a bar, tavern or other drink establishment; i.e. a double, a triple while maintaining an even division of the bottled amount.
And, while the pour themselves probably did not originate in India, the peg measurement did and, perhaps because of it's acceptance of the new smaller serving sizes of alcohol companies trying to push more sales there, the country helped make it become a standard there once it was widely accepted.

9500,2,,2022-08-02T14:47:40.460,4,,"Is there a standard for spirits and their decanter shapes?
The short answer seems to be no.
There seems to be no known standard for spirits or wine and their decanter shapes. Historically, I can find no basis for any movie to suggest there was. Obviously, not everything on TV should be taken as true, but with a grain of salt.
There seems to be main two reasons that people decant their wines. The first reason being that there is sometimes sediment in a bottle of wine and decanting wine allows sorts that sediment. The other reason that wine is decanted is to let it breathe and bring the flavor out.

Decanters And Dining Customs
Many British dining customs relied on the decanter. It was traditional to keep the glasses and bottles on a sideboard during a dinner party rather than on the table- they were only really handled by servants. However it was often the preference of the men of the group to continue drinking after the meal was over and the wives and children had retired to bed.
This lead to a lot of wine being passed around, and the unique shape of the decanter was considered to be more pleasing for this uses than the dark green bottles, as well as less likely to spill while being passed between the men. The business man George Ravenscroft (1632-1683) was one of the first people to notice that a decanter would be more appropriate for this purpose; he therefore pioneered their introduction to the English aristocracy.
The only shortcoming of this custom was the fact that, with decanters, the drinkers would not know the contents of the bottle they had been passed: hence the invention of the silver bottle label/ ticket which would be hung around the neck of a glass or silver decanter announcing its delicious contents.

A standard decanter holds 750ml of liquid.

A decanter is a vessel that is used to hold the decantation of a liquid (such as wine) which may contain sediment. Decanters, which have a varied shape and design, have been traditionally made from glass or crystal. Their volume is usually equivalent to one standard bottle of wine (0.75 litre).
Although conceived for wine, other alcoholic beverages, such as cognac or single malt Scotch whisky, are often stored and served in stoppered decanters. Certain cognacs and malt whiskies are sold in decanters such as the 50-year-old single malt Dalmore or the Bowmore Distillery 22 Year Old.


As of today, there is no stated standard for decanter shapes, one’s imagination is the limit!

Red Bull (3oz), 1 oz lime juice, oj, or lemon juice, .5oz cane sugar,
fill with ginger ale, sprite, or Fanta - Stir.  Bitter with sweetness
and a slight sourness. (Ginger ale less sweet, sprite more sweet, Fanta even more sweet)

For orangeades, depending on the brand of oj you may want to increase the amount of oj and lower or remove cane sugar.
Red Bull makes a good primary ingredient for non-alcoholic cocktails because people expect Red Bull to taste very bitter but also associate it with a premium price. You can cut the bitterness of it with soda. Fruit flavored sodas like Fanta Orange, Grape, Pineapple, and Strawberry as well as sprite mix well with Red Bull to dilute the bitterness.
The secret to a good Red Bull non-alcoholic cocktail is making something a few steps beyond what people can do at home.  From my experiences, people rarely use fresh citrus juice and Hibiscus syrup when pouring themselves something at home.
This is a suggestion for a Red Bull drink I have never sold, but I think might work:
3oz Red Bull, .5 oz lemon juice, .5 oz lime juice, 1 oz hibiscus syrup top with ginger ale - Stir.
The sour from the citrus juices and sweetness from the syrup (depending on brand) should negate a lot of the bitterness from the red bull, though some of it will still remain.

One assumes a 95 or above is a very special wine and 93 is very good. I think a grade of 90 is suspect but probably palatable. I suspect the very best values are wines rated 89.

The 100 point scale won't tell you if you will like the wine, it will just say how well the wine matches the characteristics of that style of wine.
You may love an 85 point Rhone Syrah but hate a 95 point Riesling. You should know the style of wine you like and then use the ratings to find the best wines within those regions.
Also, the scale doesnt start at 0, but at 50 - which would be an unacceptable wine. 70 - 80 is average, 80 - 90 is good, and 90 - 100 is very good to outstanding.
There are some wine reviewers that tend to give very high ratings (the infamous 99 Luca Maroni points), so that their name will appear on the lable. But appart from such shady reviewers, there are a lot of very reliable and trustworthy ones.
As an advice I would say, take several rating into account. One single 92 doesn't say very much, but when 4 or 5 renowned reviewer gave &gt;90 points, it should be a good wine. And when you find a reviewer (could also be a blogger, for example), that matches your taste, you can weigh their opinion more than others.

The difference lies in the way it is supervised within the wine making process. The wine must meet Jewish standards for religious reasons.
To be considered kosher wine, Sabbath-observant Jews must supervise the entire winemaking process and handle much of it in person, from the time the grapes are loaded into the crusher until the finished wine product is bottled and sealed.

Kosher wine is wine that is produced in accordance with halakha, and more specifically kashrut, such that Jews will be permitted to pronounce blessings over and drink it. This is an important issue, since wine is used in several Jewish ceremonies, especially those of &gt;
To be considered kosher, Sabbath-observant Jews must supervise the entire winemaking process and handle much of it in person, from the time the grapes are loaded into the crusher until the finished wine product is bottled and sealed. Additionally, any ingredients used, including finings, must be kosher. Wine that is described as &quot;kosher for Passover&quot; must have been kept free from contact with leavened or fermented grain products, a category that includes many industrial additives and agents.
When kosher wine is produced, marketed, and sold commercially, it would normally have a hechsher (kosher certification mark) issued by a kosher certification agency, or by an authoritative rabbi who is respected and known to be learned in Jewish law, or by the Kashruth Committee working under a beth din (rabbinical court of Judaism).
In recent times, there has been an increased demand for kosher wines, and a number of wine-producing countries now produce a wide variety of sophisticated kosher wines under strict rabbinical supervision, particularly in Israel, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Chile, and Australia. Two of the world's largest producers and importers of kosher wines—Kedem and Manischewitz—are both based in the American Northeast.

There is no real benefit to burning a sugar cube over a glass of absinthe, other than making it a tad bit sweeter.
It all simply part of a minor less followed traditional way of serving absinthe also known a the absinthe ritual that is followed by some.

Flaming Absinthe
One popular method is to pour the absinthe over the sugar cube while on the spoon, then light it aflame. Allow the sugar to melt into the absinthe. Extinguish the flame whenever you want with a drizzle of cold water or club soda to create the louche, then stir the remaining sugar into the liquid.
This works because absinthe is high-proof, so it will easily light on fire. However, as with any flaming drinks, you need to be very careful. Be sure to take a few safety precautions—pull back loose clothing or hair, clean up any alcohol spills, and have a fire extinguisher or, at least, a glass of water nearby—to avoid accidents. It's also not a good idea to ignite alcohol when you're drunk. Keep your wits about you and play it safe! - How to Drink Absinthe

The burning of a sugar cube is not a very popular way of serving absinthe as it could go sideways. Fire can be very dangerous and absinthe has a very high alcohol content and thus can burn quite well.
Truth be told, the sugar cube may light up for just a short moment, but the flame will quickly subside, at which point one would drizzle water over the sugar cube and into the absinthe.
Absinthe is an acquired taste of which I myself am not fond of. But that is just me.
If you go this route, please be very careful.

9541,2,,2022-12-04T23:47:08.097,3,,"What wine would pair well with carne asadas?
Let us start by explaining what carne asadas is:

Carne asada is grilled and sliced beef, usually chuck steak (known as Diezmillo in Spanish), though skirt steak or flank steak can also be used. It is usually marinated then grilled or seared to impart a charred flavor. Carne asada can be served on its own or as an ingredient in other dishes.
The term carne asada translates literally to &quot;grilled meat&quot;; the English-style dish &quot;roast beef&quot; is called by its English name in Spanish, so that each dish has a distinctive name. The term carne asada is used in Mexico and refers to the style of grilled meat in those countries. In South America, the term used for grilled meat is asado and it has a different style and preparation.
As an event
In Mexico and other countries in Central America, the phrase carne asada can also be used to describe a social event, the equivalent of a social barbecue, where family and close friends gather. Carne asada is especially popular in northern Mexico, where it is considered a staple food. It is the most common dish served at parties, celebrations, and other events in northern Mexico.

As a general rule, red wines pair well with red meats. There is no fixed absolute rule on this, but in general most people will pair a red wine with steak or beef.
As such I would recommend either a light red wine (Pinot Noir, Grenache or Barbera are some examples.) or a medium-bodied red wine (such as Merlot, Shiraz, Tempranillo or Nebbiolo).
Whatever you decide is fine. So bon appetite and enjoy your meal.

First of all what are Dunkels?

Dunkel is the German word meaning dark, and dunkel beers typically range in color from amber to dark reddish brown. They are characterized by their smooth malty flavor. In informal terms, such as when ordering at a bar, &quot;dunkel&quot; is likely to mean whatever dark beer the bar has on tap, or sells most of; in much of north and western Germany, especially near Düsseldorf, this may be Altbier. - Dunkel

They have in stock Warsteiner Dunkel and Erdinger Dunkel, Hofbrau Dunkel, Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunke, Ayinger Altabairisch Dunkel and Weltenburger Barock Dunkel.
Occasionally, they are out of stock, but then so are other outlets. Check around and you will be able to locate some Dunkles here or there. The bigger outlets are best to deal with.
If BevMo is unable to obtain a certain variety, look elsewhere. They are in several different states.

Purists argue that if the cocktail contains only alcohol-based ingredients (spirits, vermouths, liqueurs) it should be stirred; if it contains any non-alcoholic ingredients (citrus juice, eggs, cream, fresh fruit or herbs), it should be shaken. (Some examples of classic shaken/stirred styles at Masterclass.com.)
But as with anything food and drink, that's mostly nonsense - it should all really be about preference.
For example, the Martini - the rule is that it should be stirred, and that is also supposed to keep the delicate taste, and the oily nature of the vermouth, but many people prefer it shaken. Probably Ian Fleming's fault, but there you go.
If you invent a cocktail, try it both ways, and ask testers to try both ways, and see what they like.

This question reminds me of the liqueur Chartreuse made with 130 herbs, plants and flowers.

Chartreuse is a French herbal liqueur available in green and yellow versions that differ in taste and alcohol content. The liqueur has been made by the Carthusian monks since 1737 according to the instructions set out in a manuscript given to them by François Annibal d'Estrées in 1605. It was named after the monks' Grande Chartreuse monastery, located in the Chartreuse Mountains north of Grenoble. Today the liqueur is produced in their distillery in nearby Aiguenoire. It is composed of distilled alcohol aged with 130 herbs, plants and flowers.

In all fairness, drinking Chartreuse is an acquired taste. It quite different.
Plants I would grow for cocktail usage would be mint, rosemary and basil.

9560,2,,2023-02-17T16:30:25.407,1,,"from my own experience: sparkling wine, champagne, beer or other drinks containing CO2 expand more during freezing than liquids without CO2, which can lead to cracked bottles (if glas) or at least leaks at the lid ending up with a lot of frozen liquid in the freezer. Especially with champagne, although I haven't tried it, it gets worse because the pressure is much higher than with beer and the bottles are really closed. Do not try it at all! I think my father had once an exploded bottle of champagne in his freezer. He needed to clean everything because of the glas and odeur! Even, if everything went well, the sparkling character is clearly lost for drinks like cola or lemonade.
With wine it's a bit different. Here it definitely depends on the lid and if the bottle is horizontal or vertical frozen. If it's layed and has a screw-on lid (which has become more and more common in recent years, at least in my wine region), you can be lucky and only a few mL will leak out, but usually the bottles remain intact. The liquid that leaks is the one that freezes last, because it contains the sugar, the aromas and the alcohol. Or the other way round: water freezes first. So if all the liquid has remained in the bottle, it makes no difference for most of us, but please let it thaw completely before pouring it into your glass. If some liquid has leaked out, just try the wine and if it doesn't taste the way you like/expect it, you may still be able to use it as an ingredient in your next sauce.
With cork, i don't have so much experience, but the cork will be pushed out a bit (if possible, so no plastic coverage arround), but very likely prevents leakage.
In summer I often forgot to take the wine out at the right time (before freezing), so I ended up with something like a slushi made with wine. Just shake it thoroughly until you get a nice mixture, then pour it into a glass. You will see, it thaws faster than a bottle of water. This is for white or rose wine.  Ok, maybe you should not do something like this with high quality or rare wine. You can also improve it and make a nice looking cocktail out of it, fancy, he?
After few bottles forgotten in the freezer, i made a little magnetic batch, which i pin on the door. So, everbody who sees it, opens and checks. Since then, the amount of forgotten bottels decreased significantly!
I don't drink red wine, but is there a reason why you should drink a really cold red wine?
However, with cooking, there will be a difference, because all the volatile aromas will disapear as well as some of the alcohol. Of course, it depends on the duration and the heat.
Long storage in a frozen state is not advisable. But as long as all the liquid remains in the bottle, it is not a problem, at least for bottles with screw caps. With the cork, I guess it depends on the interaction between the cork and the temperature. It is possible that at least the inner part of the cork will dissolve a little when the bottle is opened and that cork crumbs will end up in the wine.

The presence of impurities: The fermentation and distillation process might not have been thorough, leading to the presence of impurities in your brandy. To fix this issue, you can try refining your distillation process or using a better filtration method.

Copper reaction: If you're using copper equipment during distillation, it's possible that the copper is reacting with compounds in the Paw Paw fruit, leading to a blue tint. To minimize this, make sure your equipment is clean and well-maintained. Additionally, you can try using stainless steel equipment to see if the issue persists.

Fruit quality: The quality and ripeness of the Paw Paw fruit used in your recipe could affect the final color. Make sure to use ripe, high-quality fruit, and consider experimenting with different varieties of Paw Paw to see if the blue cast is specific to a certain type.

Oxidation: If the blue cast appears after bottling or storing the brandy, it could be due to oxidation. To minimize oxidation, make sure to store the brandy in a cool, dark place and use bottles with airtight seals.

Natural colorants: Some fruits, including Paw Paw, contain pigments such as anthocyanins that can cause color changes in the final product. You can try adding fining agents like activated carbon to help remove these color compounds, but be cautious as this may also strip some of the flavors from your brandy.


Please consult with a professional or do further research before making any significant changes to your process.

To one degree or another this is a personal choice., no matter where the pub is located. However there are three are three general points of criteria that should be observed: great food, cleanliness, and a awesome atmosphere!
Of course atmosphere is in the eyes of the beholder, so some looking around may be involved. Great pubs will make you feel at home and should be open to suggestions as to another pub, if one is looking for a particular type of dining and drinking atmosphere that caters to an individual’s different tastes in food, drink or even music (atmosphere). If pubs are not friendly or overly noisy, they are not worthy of being called a pub with a great atmosphere.

This was the one we were most excited to taste. With the limited selection of melon liqueurs available on the market, they all taste as artificial as their green coloring. Upon first taste, we were not disappointed. Like a sweet fresh cantaloupe, this was every bit what we wanted in a true melon liqueur. The cream takes a back seat is this drink, letting the Assisi melon taste take the stage. We had to investigate this melon as it tasted so similar to cantaloupe. It turns out that the melon is named for the city it’s grown in, Assisi, Italy. The only thing we can really compare this liqueur to is the time we got over excited about a new juicer and ran an entire cantaloupe through it. Time well spent. - Francescano Liqueurs

The raw spirit distilled isn't whisky at this point, in fact it could be made into various things. What makes it whisky is then the maturation process in wooden casks for years, during which compounds leach from the wood giving the whisky colour and flavour.

When you add just a small amount (no more than a few ml) of water to whiskey, it drops the solubility of the liquor, and a great number of different volatile compounds then fall out of solution and float to the top. This modifies the taste of the whiskey in a way that's very noticeably different from simple dilution — you may have experienced this before, especially with higher proof drinks such as cask strength whiskey. The chilling from the ice also changes how your tongue perceives different flavors, so there's likely a compounding effect of this technique.
So, if you let an ice cube melt slightly before adding whiskey, it should make the whiskey taste much different from neat, and different still from both a water &amp; whiskey and a whiskey on rocks.

Cork Taint (TCA Contamination): This is the most well-known issue with corks, resulting in a musty, moldy, or wet cardboard-like aroma and flavor in the wine.
Oxidation: When the cork fails to create a proper seal, oxygen can enter the bottle, leading to premature aging and oxidation of the wine, resulting in a flat, stale taste.
Cork Drying Out: Over time, corks can dry out and shrink, allowing air to seep into the bottle, potentially leading to loss of freshness and changes in taste.
Cork Disintegration: In some cases, corks can disintegrate or crumble upon opening the bottle, causing cork particles to enter the wine.
Cork Leakage: Small gaps between the cork and the bottle neck can result in wine slowly leaking out, potentially altering the wine's concentration and taste.
Conglomerated Cork Glue Taste: Wines sealed with conglomerated corks can sometimes exhibit a glue-like or chemical taste or aroma, depending on the quality of the cork and the adhesive used.

Transitioning wine from vertical to horizontal storage should not have a negative impact on the wine, especially if it's done carefully and the bottles are in good condition. Once moved, the bottles should be monitored more often than usual, especially for sings of leakage.

Oxygen Exchange: Larger bottles typically have a smaller ratio of wine surface area to bottle volume compared to smaller bottles.

As a result, wine in larger bottles tends to age more slowly because there is less oxygen exchange. Considering also that the amount of air exchanged by the cork is almost the same for all the bottle sizes.
Temperature Stability: Larger bottles tend to have more stable temperatures because they have a higher thermal mass. This means that temperature fluctuations in the wine cellar or storage area can have a slower and less pronounced effect on the wine inside the larger bottle.

The short answer is maybe.
Personally I would be careful about drinking this if produced from the country of origin, since quality control does not exist in Iran!

Aragh sagi is a type of Iranian moonshine. This distilled alcoholic beverage usually contains around 50% alcohol. However, since it was produced without much quality control, it may have contained more or less alcohol, at times even reaching 80%. A high-quality aragh sagi tastes similar to grappa. Some Western sources call it Persian or Iranian Vodka.
Since the Iranian revolution in 1979, Alcohol is illegal in Iran. As such, homemade Aragh sagi in Iran is produced illegally.
It is usually produced in homes from fermented raisins. Its production and possession by ordinary citizens is considered illegal in Iran (which is the case for all alcoholic beverages in Iran). Prior to 1979 revolution in Iran, this product had been produced traditionally in several cities, such as Yazd. Since it was outlawed after 1979, it became a black market and underground business. Today, aragh sagi is widely considered a cheap alcoholic beverage that consumers choose due to lack of other available alternative options.

Other, more controlled countries do made this and thus would be fine to drink. Again, if it comes from the country of origin be careful about drinking it.
Aragh sagi is a popular Persian drink made by distilling sultana raisins. It's aged in oak barrels for 18 months, giving its unique flavour profile. Expect aromas and flavours of oak, vanilla, baking spice, and raisin. Full-bodied with a long-lasting finish. Serve alongside a rack of lamb or enjoy over ice as an after-dinner delight.

9642,2,,2023-11-02T10:19:43.137,1,,"A lot of the aging potential of wine (or beer even) has to do with oxygen.  If you didn't put a lid on the bottle, it would oxidise pretty quickly as it is exposed to the air.  It would go from red to brown, the delicate flavour compounds would also break down.  It would look and taste bad.  It might also get infected with air borne bacteria.  All of this will happen eventually with a lid on the bottle - just much more slowly.  We have a couple of friends at least fighting for us against this process.  Our friends are anti-oxidants.  Tannin, contained mainly in the stalks and skins of grapes is a powerful anti-oxidant.  The more tannin, the longer the life.  This is why red lasts longer than white as the grape must lies on the grapes to give it colour (anthocyans - also anti-oxidant) and structure (bitterness etc), whereas white wine is from grape juice pressed out straight away.  A white made like a red (vin orange) would last longer in the bottle.  Another friend in some (many) cases is sulphur.  Sulphur is an anti-oxidant and anti-bacterial agent.  To answer your question, the amount of free sulphites at the point of bottling can be measured, and these get 'consumed' over a period of time.  Therefore, experts with suitable measurements could have a clue as to the longevity of a particular vintage.  There is a large amount of subjectivity however as some people value the character that slow oxidisation can bring whilst others like fresh wine.  Sherry is a good example, well liked but often highly oxidised.  This discussion is also relevant to beer.  Hops contain a powerful anti-oxidant called alpha-acid.  This can also be measured and so can give you an estimate of the aging potential of a beer.  Ever left a half drunk bottle of beer open overnight and tried it the next morning?  Eugh!  Try taking a sip from a very hoppy modern IPA left out overnight.  It's close to drinkable compared with a cheap beer such as (US) Bud that contains few hops.

9643,1,9663,2023-11-02T22:59:33.967,1,160,"I have encountered several types of simple syrup when it comes to cocktails. Firstly there is the question of mass ratio vs volume ratio. Then what ratio to use. I don't use simple syrup that often and heard that a 2:1 mass ratio simple syrup could be stored longer, so I made that. Usually recipes use a 1:1 volume ratio or a 1:1 mass ratio I think? Anyway: I want to know if there are any other ratios used? (other than 2:1 and 1:1) For example 3:2. Is there any point in making a syrup stronger than 2:1 (will the sugar dissolve properly, is it practical to have such strong syrup, and will it last longer in storage)?

Some context (not neccecary for the answer, but can clarify why I am asking):
I wondered how you could substitute a 1:1 syrup with a 2:1 syrup and still have the same mass (g) of sugar in you cocktail (as to not make it too sweet). Since I enjoy playing around with math I set about to discover a formula for this (but with any ratios), and I did. More precicley I dicovered 4 formulas, depending on if the recipe syrup ratio is given in mass or volume and if the syrup substitute ratio is given in mass or volume. This formula only depends on the ratio of the syrups, the density of the syrups and the density of sugar (when you measure it by volume). Therefore I want to measure some simple syrup densities to correctly substitute simple syrup in recipes. Here are the four formulas if you wondered:

The delta (δ) is just the density of water: 1g/mL (to make the units match). These formulas calculate the transition from syrup 1 to syrup 2:

The formulas are for (in order from left to right): mass ratio -&gt; mass ratio, volume ratio -&gt; volume ratio, volume ratio -&gt; mass ratio, mass ratio -&gt; volume ratio. Meaning that if I want to substitute a 1:1 volume ratio syrup with my 2:1 mass ratio syrup, I use formula number 3 from the left to calculate how much 2:1 syrup (in mL) I should include to have the same amount of sugar as in the recipe.
I use an index of 1 to indicate the recipe syrup and an index of 2 to indicate the substitute syrup. Also: yes, I know this isn't really neccecary and you can just take about the sam amount. However, I enjoyed doing the math and thinking. Since I already have this I thought that maybe I should use it? To do this I need to measure the densities of different syrups, so the question is more or less: which syrups should I measure? I want to measure different syrups encountered in recipes, but I don't know of any other than 1:1 and 2:1, so I thought I'd ask here what ratios you have encountered in cocktail recipes.

My thoughts:
A 1:1 ratio syrup is 1/(1+1)=1/2=50% sugar (by volume or mass) and a 2:1 ratio syrup is 2/(2+1)=2/3≈67% sugar (by volume or mass). Since there is not that much difference between a 50% and 67% mix I can understand that you would just use the same amount without making too big of a difference. Also it probably doesn't make much sense to do a 3:2 syrup: 3/(3+2)=3/5=60% sugar, since this is very close to the 2:1 syrup.
I wonder if it would be any point to making a say 80% sugar syrup (4:1)? Or maybe a syrup with less than 50% sugar? However, I can not see how a syrup with less than 50% sugar could be useful other than for people who can consume sugar, but need to do so in small amounts. Then maybe a cocktail/mocktail with 20-30% sugar would be prefered instead?
After all of this I am tempted to make a recipe using a 3:2 syrup. This way you could probably use a 2:1 syrup instead just fine, but it would be funny to know that perfectionists eighter had to make a new kind of syrup just for this one cocktail or have to live with the fact that they didn't make the cocktail properly according to the recipe.

Sorry that this was so long and technical. Although the syrup itself is not related to alcohol, the context of the question is indeed related to it (cocktail recipes). Thus I hope this question can be accepted (also you do not have to read the context to answer the question).

9644,2,,2023-11-03T18:25:03.197,1,,"I started to use this count:




Count:
Do
Re
Mi
Fa
So
La
Ti
Do




Volume [mL]:
5
10
15
20
25
30
35
40




Here are my reasons for chosing this count system:

The syllables take roughly the same time to pronounce. This ensures a nice consistency in the count (the same amount of liquid flows from the bottle at each count because they take the same time to &quot;pronounce&quot;). A number counting system does not have this feature as &quot;seven&quot; and &quot;thirteen&quot; would take longer to pronounce than &quot;one&quot; (not a big difference, but still a bigger difference)
The five mL increments are useful. This allows me to easily measure say 15mL or 45mL, which would be harder in another system.
It is easy for me to count 40mL. This is a common measure in drinks at bars, resturants, etc. where I live (due to alcohol regulations I think). I know that if I finish the whole count, I have 40mL. Easy to remember.
It is easy to remember. It is very easy (at least for me) to remember the count due to its relation to music. This allows me to focus more on training my timing so that I pour the correct amount. I also need to learn to quickly convert from count to mL (i.e. Do-Re-Mi = 15mL), but this needs to be done regardless of counting system. An easy to remember count lets me focus more on these things.
The counts (most of the time) does not repeat. My other suggested count ba-ba-ba-ba-car-di had a lot of repeated ba's which made it hard to differentiate between 10mL or 15mL. The only problem here is over 40mL, where there are two do's in a row (re-starting the count). However, this is not really a problem as I also &quot;sing it with tones&quot; such that the first do has a low tone and the last one has a high tone. This way they are sort of &quot;different&quot; and I don't have a problem confusing them.
I can take my sweet time pronouncing the count (due to its shortness). The shortness of each syllable ensures that I have more than enough time to pronounce them before the next syllable. If I were to use a something longer like &quot;seven&quot; I'd need to pronounce it quicker to ensure that I don't overpour. An extreme example: imagine counting &quot;baseballplayer&quot; for 5mL. You may have poured 10mL by the time you have pronounced &quot;baseballplayer&quot;.
It calms me and slows down my time perception. This is related to the previous point. Since the syllables are so short, i often end up with something like &quot;dooooo-reeeee-miiiii-faaaaa&quot; (slow pronounciation). Saying it slowly is calming and gives an illution that the pouring is &quot;slow&quot;, giving me more control during the pour.
Since it doesn't use numbers it still allows me to use the imperial count as well. I mentioned this in my question, but this is indeed practical. The recipe specifies 1oz? No problem: I can use the imperial count system. The recipe specifies 40mL? No problem: I can use this count system. Now it doesn't matter if the recipe uses oz or mL (or cL). I can measure them both.
(Bonus): Even when I use the count many times, it doesn't quickly become annoying or tiring. I feel some counts could become annoying very qucikly, but this one works fine for me. I guess it is because I use different tones to pronounce the syllables that it doesn't get monotomous, boring or annoying quickly.

Or dilute with water and add simple syrup - and adjust accordingly. For amaretto, unless its disaranno, you won't find anything close to it even with alcohol... I might low slow boil one off in the event of your mocktail not working out right.  But, Finest Call makes an amaretto flavored mixer, I would try that first, for price and availability.

1 cup water

1 cup white sugar

1 cup fresh basil leaves


Directions
Combine water, sugar, and basil leaves in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let syrup steep for 30 minutes.
Drain syrup through a mesh strainer into a sterilized glass jar; discard basil leaves. Let cool, then cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

9663,2,,2024-01-19T16:40:16.677,2,,"In my experience, it's all down to the &quot;House style&quot;. I have worked in bars where all of the recipes are made with 1:1 and I have also worked bars where everything is 2:1, 3:2 is somewhat rarer but not out of the question. All of these ratios are by weight to be more accurate and use caster sugar as the grain size is smaller and therefore dissolves faster.
I think there is an advantage to each ratio, namely the speed of dissolution.
1:1 (50 brix) is super easy to make and the sugar completely dissolves in cold water. It's better suited to drinks where dilution isn't a problem, so for crushed ice drinks etc. It pours very easily through a standard speed pourer but is less shelf-stable so will need to be refrigerated and used very quickly. This suits the at-home bartender fine, it incorporates easily into drinks although you will need to use more per drink to get the same sweetness. This could be a downside to bar use as bartenders will go through a higher volume of syrup and that'll need topping up sooner.
2:1 (67 brix) is a little more difficult to make as it requires either hot water to make or needs to be brought to a boil and vigorous stirring for all of the sugar crystals to dissolve. The advantage is that you will be adding less water to your drinks so you can concentrate flavours more. This syrup does need to be worked a bit more to fully incorporate through shaking, stirring etc as it tends to fall to the bottom of a drink in a layer if not mixed properly. This is also slightly more shelf-stable and can be kept for longer, suiting most bars although it is very difficult to pour through a standard speed-pourer as it is too viscous, requiring a jet-pourer (which has a larger mouth) to be used effectively. There is also a tendency for this ratio to re-crystalise if it is kept cold for too long (although commercial &quot;gomme&quot; manufacturers use anti-crystallisation additives to combat this sometimes) and any crystallised sugar counts against the effective sweetness so it can be a downside.
A 3:2 ratio (60 brix) generally cuts the balance between the 1:1 useability and the 2:1 intensity. It can be made with cold water easily, poured easily and (generally speaking) lasts longer than 1:1.
The only potential downside to a 3:2 ratio is that most recipes found on the internet either use 1:1 &quot;simple&quot; syrup or 2:1 &quot;rich&quot; syrup so translating the intended sweetness of any given cocktail could prove to be tough.
It's very tough to dissolve sugar into water any more than 67 brix, you can get to 70 brix (7:3 ratio) by heating a 2:1 sugar syrup to the point that it becomes inverted syrup, although that chemically changes the perceived sweetness so it isn't advised unless you are making shelf-stable products that are made on a mass scale. Making it yourself is inadvisable anyway as its difficult to determine how much water is lost due to evaporation.
As for a 4:1 (80 brix) ratio syrup, there is little point trying this in terms of making something useful for cocktails as it will be very difficult to dissolve all the sugar crystals and even then, it would be very difficult to incorporate into drinks and also re-crystallise when left alone.
A 1:2 (33 brix) syrup would only be useful if the resulting drink could cope with heaps of dilution, not to mention you'll be making a syrup that could spontaneously ferment quickly if not made entirely sterile.
It's up to you but a 3:2 syrup has a lot of advantages over the other recipes if you are willing to translate some recipes to get the balance right. If you are coming up with your own recipes then you'll just be developing your &quot;House Style&quot;
